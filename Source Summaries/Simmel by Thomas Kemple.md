## Georg Simmel: The Man Who Saw Everything (And Fit Nowhere)

If sociology had a color palette, Georg Simmel would be that weird, shimmering shade you can’t quite name. You know it’s there, you can see it vibrating against the primary colors, but it refuses to sit in a neat little box. Thomas Kemple’s exploration of Simmel suggests that this refusal to blend in wasn't a flaw—it was the whole point.

Simmel was the academic equivalent of a jazz chord in a marching band. He was brilliant, sure, but he didn't fit the mold. This friction defined his life. He wasn't just observing the concept of "The Stranger"—the person who comes today and stays tomorrow—he was living it. He was the insider who remained an outsider, standing in the doorway of the party, analyzing the room while everyone else was just drinking the punch.

**The Berlin Hustle**

To get Simmel, you have to get Berlin in the late 19th century.

He was born into a city that was exploding into a modern metropolis. We’re talking rapid industrialization, cultural whiplash, and the kind of noise that rattles your teeth. This chaos was his laboratory.

But while the city moved fast, the academy moved slowly. Simmel faced a mountain of rejection. Despite being a popular lecturer—students loved him—he couldn't land a salaried gig to save his life. Part of this was undoubtedly due to antisemitism in the German academy (Simmel was baptized Protestant, but came from a Jewish family), and part of it was his refusal to "stay in his lane." He mixed philosophy, history, and psychology into a cocktail that traditionalists found distasteful. For years, he lived off student fees and an inheritance, a "gig economy" professor long before that was a term.

**The Big Ask: "How is Society Possible?"**

Simmel wasn't interested in the heavy, structural beams of society. He looked at the mortar. He didn't ask "Why do we have laws?" He asked, "How is it possible that a bunch of individuals hallucinate a collective reality called 'society'?"

He looked for the "apriorities"—the unspoken rules of engagement. Think about when you walk into a coffee shop. You, the barista, and the person behind you in line all silently agree to a complex dance of interaction. That tension, that silent negotiation of space and role? That’s Simmel’s playground. He didn't see society as a "thing" (a noun); he saw it as _sociation_ (a verb). It’s something we _do_, constantly.

**The Greatest Hits**

Kemple walks us through where Simmel applied this laser vision:

- **Money Talks (and it says "Goodbye"):** Simmel’s _Philosophy of Money_ isn’t about economics; it’s about how cold, hard cash changes our souls. Money turns unique, qualitative things (a hand-knit scarf) into quantitative values ($45.00). It liberates us because we can trade with anyone, anywhere, but it also creates a massive emotional distance. It makes relationships objective. As Simmel noted, "money has no smell." It strips the personality out of the exchange.
    
- **The City State of Mind:** In _The Metropolis and Mental Life_, Simmel diagnosed the modern urbanite with a condition we all recognize: the "blasé" attitude. To survive the sensory overload of the city—the lights, the crowds, the noise—we develop a protective shell. We become calculating and slightly indifferent. It’s not that we’re mean; it’s that we’re overstimulated. We preserve our subjectivity by shutting down a little bit.
    
- **Secrets and Lies:** Simmel was fascinated by what we _don't_ say. He argued that secrecy is a fundamental building block of society. If we knew everything about everyone, social bonds would snap. We need the "mask" to function. The lie, the omission, the private thought—these create the necessary distance that allows us to be together.
    

**The Tragedy of Stuff**

Later in life, Simmel got existential. He worried about the "tragedy of culture." Basically, humans create "objective culture"—technology, art, institutions, books. But eventually, this pile of stuff becomes so massive and complex that the individual ("subjective culture") can't absorb or control it anymore. We built the machine, and now the machine is too big for us to drive. We become alienated by our own creations. Sound familiar?

**The Inheritance**

Simmel never built a rigid "School of Simmel." He knew his work wasn't a cathedral; it was a currency. He famously said his legacy would be like cash distributed among many heirs, each using it for their own purposes, forgetting where it came from.

And he was right. From urban studies to the way we think about social media networks today, we are spending Simmel’s coin. Reading him now isn't about finding a dusty answer key; it's about learning how to see the cracks in the pavement where the real life happens.

**Eloise:** Oh, this poor man! Can you imagine? Being so brilliant that you can see the invisible wires connecting everyone in a room, but because of that sight, you feel completely alone? It breaks my heart, but in a beautiful way. I love that he validated the "blasé" feeling. It’s not that we don't care, Clarence! It’s that we care _too much_ and the city is just... loud! We have to protect our little hearts. Also, the idea that secrets are the glue of society? That is so spicy! It makes you look at your neighbors differently. Do you think he was lonely, or do you think he enjoyed the view from the doorway?

**Clarence:** He was definitely lonely, Eloise. You don't write about the "Tragedy of Culture" because you're having a blast at the biergarten. But I appreciate his precision. He didn't try to fix the world; he just wanted to understand the mechanics of the breakage. And that point about money turning quality into quantity? That is the nightmare we are currently living in. Everything is a metric now. I feel seen, and I don't like it. He’s right, though—we are absolutely spending his coin. We just forgot he minted it.

**Next Logical Question:** Given Simmel’s theory on the "Tragedy of Culture" where our creations outpace our ability to absorb them, how would he likely analyze the current state of Artificial Intelligence and the internet?
