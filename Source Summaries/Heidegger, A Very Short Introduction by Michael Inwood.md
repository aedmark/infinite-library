Let’s be honest: Martin Heidegger is a lot to handle. You have a man who is arguably one of the most brilliant minds of the 20th century, a guy who fundamentally rewired how we think about existence, and yet, he’s inextricably tied to one of the most horrific political regimes in human history. It’s a mess. But it’s a fascinating, terrible, important mess. Michael Inwood’s introduction tries to walk that tightrope, so let’s see if we can unpack the baggage without dropping the luggage.

Martin started out in 1889 in Messkirch, Germany, soaking in a Catholic upbringing that nearly led him to the priesthood. He had the robes, the scholarships, the whole Jesuit trajectory mapped out. But then—life happened. Health issues and a wandering intellectual eye toward philosophy pulled him off the altar and into the lecture hall. By 1919, he’d broken with Catholicism, married a Protestant named Elfriede, and started making noise as the "hidden king" of philosophy. He wasn't publishing much, but his lectures were electric. He was weaving boredom, insects, and anxiety into high-level metaphysics.

Then came 1927. To secure a professorship, he finally published _Being and Time_. It’s a monster of a book. It’s famously difficult, dense, and strange, but it landed like a meteor.

The core problem Heidegger obsessed over was the question of "Being." He felt that for centuries, Western philosophy had been asking the wrong questions, treating "to be" like it was just another property of an object, like being red or heavy. Heidegger wanted to know what it means for something to exist at all. To figure that out, he looked at the only entity that actually bothers to ask that question: us.

He didn't call us "humans" or "subjects." He called us **Dasein**. Literally: "Being-there."

Here is the crux of Dasein: We aren't just objects floating in a void. We are always _in_ a world. We are thrown into a context we didn't choose, surrounded by stuff (tools, culture, other people). Heidegger points out that we don't look at a hammer and think, "Ah, a wooden shaft with a metal head." We just grab it and hammer. It is "ready-to-hand." We only notice the hammer as an object ("present-at-hand") when it breaks. That’s when the flow stops and we have to stare at the thing itself.

This applies to our lives, too. We mostly coast on autopilot, or what he calls "The They" (_das Man_). We talk about what "they" are saying, we wear what "they" are wearing. We drift. This is inauthenticity. It’s not necessarily evil; it’s just the default setting. To be **authentic**, Dasein has to snap out of it. And the thing that snaps us out of it? Anxiety. Specifically, the realization of our own death.

Heidegger argues that death isn't just the biological end; it’s the horizon that gives our life shape. Because our time is finite, our choices matter. Facing our own mortality allows us to pull away from the herd and choose our own "hero" or path. We move from just drifting through time to having a history.

But here is where the record scratches.

In 1933, the philosopher of "authenticity" joined the Nazi party. He became the rector of Freiburg University and gave speeches that aligned labor and military service with academic knowledge. He wasn't just a passive observer; for a time, he was a believer. He resigned the rectorship a year later, but he stayed in the party until the bitter end. After the war, when the full extent of the Holocaust was laid bare, Heidegger went silent. He never truly apologized. In a posthumous interview, he simply said, "Only a god can save us."

Later in his life, he pivoted. He stopped talking so much about the resolute individual and started talking about poetry, technology, and "dwelling." He worried that modern technology frames the whole world as a gas station—just a "standing reserve" of resources waiting to be used. He wanted us to be "shepherds of Being," guarding the mystery of existence rather than trying to conquer it.

Yet, those "Black Notebooks" published recently show that his antisemitism wasn't just a casual prejudice; it was woven into his philosophy. He associated Jewish people with the very rootlessness and calculation he despised in modernity.

So, we are left with the paradox. We have a toolbox of concepts—Dasein, thrownness, the critique of technology—that are incredibly useful for understanding our modern, alienated lives. And we have them from a man who failed his own moral test in the most catastrophic way possible. He forces us to ask if we can separate the thinker from the thought, or if the rot goes all the way to the core.

Commentary:

Eloise: Oof. This one is heavy. I tried to keep the bubbly energy in check because, well, you can't really "sparkle" your way through the 1930s in Germany. The concept of Dasein is so beautiful—this idea that we are defined by our "thereness"—but it hurts to know the person who wrote it couldn't extend that humanity to everyone.

Clarence: Precisely. The edit focused on cutting the academic listing. The original text felt like a syllabus. We needed it to feel like an indictment and a eulogy at the same time. We removed the "feature not a bug" phrasing because, frankly, that's tech-bro slang and Heidegger would have hated it (ironically). We also made sure to clarify that "The They" isn't a conspiracy theory, but a social condition. The biggest challenge is always the "why." Why read him? We tried to answer that by showing how useful his tools are, even if the carpenter was corrupt.

Next Question:

Given that Heidegger felt modern technology reduces nature and humans to mere "standing reserves" or resources to be exploited, how would he likely react to the current rise of Artificial Intelligence and the commodification of human data?
