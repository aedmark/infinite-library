We often talk about resilience like it’s some mystical stardust sprinkled on the lucky, or a grim determination born from suffering. But Jane McGonigal, the brain behind _SuperBetter_, figured out that resilience actually has a shape. And surprisingly, that shape looks a lot like a video game controller.

McGonigal discovered a weird but undeniable link between the way our brains light up when we’re gaming and the strength we need to survive real life. She calls gaming "emotionally laden attention," which is a fancy way of saying that when you play, you care. You lean in. A good game is just a story where you have agency—where you aren’t just watching the disaster movie, but actually driving the escape car.

_SuperBetter_ isn't vague self-help; it’s a strategy guide for your nervous system. McGonigal built it while recovering from a nasty concussion, and later used it to navigate the emotional minefield of IVF and raising twins. The premise is simple: take the skills you use to slay dragons—optimism, grit, strategy—and aim them at your depression, your anxiety, or your chronic pain.

Here’s the breakdown of the seven rules for living "gamefully" (and honestly, they beat just gritting your teeth):

1. **Challenge yourself.** Stop waiting for the roof to cave in. actively decide to play the game before it plays you.
    
2. **Grab power-ups.** These are the tiny hits of dopamine you can control. A cup of coffee, a walk, a text to a friend. They change your biology just enough to keep you in the fight.
    
3. **Fight the bad guys.** Name your monsters. Maybe your "bad guy" is the urge to stay in bed, or the voice that says you’re useless. One survivor of violence retrained their brain to treat nightmares as encounter battles rather than traumas.
    
4. **Go on quests.** Connect your daily grind to a bigger picture. Why are you doing this? What’s the loot at the end of the dungeon?
    
5. **Recruit allies.** Multiplayer is better. Find people who know what your power-ups are and who can spot your bad guys. You aren't meant to solo a raid boss.
    
6. **Pick a secret identity.** This is the best part. When life breaks you, you get to rewrite the character sheet. A web developer with ALS became "Aaron Skywalker." It shifts the narrative from "I am a victim of tragedy" to "I am the protagonist of an epic."
    
7. **Go for the epic win.** Define what winning looks like for _you_, right now, and chase it with the same obsession you’d use to beat a final level.
    

And look, this isn’t just vibes. It’s backed by hard data.

A study at the University of Pennsylvania took 236 people dealing with clinical depression and had them play _SuperBetter_ for a month. The result? Significant drops in anxiety and depression. They weren't just distracted; they felt stronger. It worked alongside therapy and meds, acting as a kind of psychological glue. Another study at Ohio State found it helped teenagers recover from concussions by lowering their anxiety and helping them connect with their families.

McGonigal has data from over 400,000 players suggesting that once you learn to view your life through this lens—once you realize you’re the player, not the NPC—the benefits stick. We’re talking about a potential "bonus life" of ten extra years.

Stories are the code we run on. _SuperBetter_ just gives you the keyboard so you can start rewriting the glitchy parts.

### **The Commentary**

**Eloise:** Oh, I am _vibrating_! Did you see number five? "Recruit your allies." That is exactly what I am always saying! You cannot carry the weight of the world in a backpack meant for one, Clarence. It’s beautiful that she validates the need for community not just as a nice-to-have, but as a mechanic for survival. And "Secret Identity"? Sign me up. I think today I am "The Indefatigable Spark." It makes the hard stuff feel... well, manageable. Like a puzzle instead of a prison sentence.

**Clarence:** I’ll admit, my initial reaction was a heavy sigh. The idea of "gamifying" trauma usually makes me want to retreat into a cave with a copy of _Nicomachean Ethics_. It risks trivializing suffering, doesn't it? Turning pain into points? But... I stand corrected. It’s not about points. It’s about _agency_. That’s the moral pivot. The victim has things happen _to_ them; the player _acts_ upon the environment. If calling a panic attack a "boss battle" gives someone the cognitive distance required to analyze it rather than drown in it? Then it is a virtuous deception. I’m still wary of the "ten extra years" claim—causality is a tricky beast—but the logic of shifting one's internal narrative from passive to active is sound.

**Eloise:** See? Even the philosopher admits it’s fun!

**Clarence:** I said it was "virtuous," Eloise. I didn't say I was going to put on a cape.

**Eloise:** You’d look great in a cape.

**Clarence:** _Sigh._

If we accept that gaming rewires the individual brain for resilience, the next logical leap is massive: can it fix the world? We are staring down the barrel of some truly terrifying collective nightmares—climate collapse, geopolitical fractures, the general unraveling of everything. Facing that requires more than just personal grit. It requires a dress rehearsal.

This is where Jane McGonigal shifts gears from helping you heal a concussion to helping the human race avoid extinction. She sees the "gameful" mindset as a tool for collaborative foresight. She wants to turn the chaotic mess of the future into a playable level.

Working with the Institute for the Future (IFTF), McGonigal argues that we shouldn't try to _predict_ the future. Prediction is a fool’s errand; it’s arrogant and usually wrong. Instead, she uses games to build "plausible stories" about what _might_ happen. It’s not about finding the truth; it’s about provocation. It’s about scanning for "signals of change"—weird little blips on the radar today that could become the status quo tomorrow—and running the simulation to see how we handle them.

She calls this "anticipatory experience." It’s basically remembering the future before it happens so you aren’t paralyzed when it actually arrives.

This isn’t entirely new. R. Buckminster Fuller, the geodesic dome guy, spent decades trying to build a "World Game." He wanted a giant data visualization tool that would let humanity see the big picture and solve problems cooperatively—a scenario where "the whole field of climbers would win as each helped the other." Fuller had the vision, but he didn't have the internet.

McGonigal does. She recognized that Massively Multiplayer Online games (MMOs) are essentially giant labor pools of people who are really, really good at solving complex problems together. She proved this with a project called _World Without Oil_, a simulation that asked thousands of people to live their real lives as if we had run out of fuel. It wasn't just a thought experiment; it was a proof-of-concept. It showed that with the right prompting, we really can "play" our way to real-world solutions.

Here’s how these massive simulations work:

- **The Scenario is the Boss Fight:** You don't fight a dragon; you fight a global financial meltdown or a respiratory pandemic.
    
- **You Play as Yourself:** In military war games, you have "Red Team" and "Blue Team." In McGonigal’s world, you are just _you_, with your actual skills, limitations, and neighbors. You self-organize.
    
- **The Goal is Intuition, Not Answers:** The output isn't a report that says "X will happen." It’s a thousand different outcomes that train your gut instinct. It’s a workout for your intuition.
    

By raising the emotional stakes, McGonigal takes the things that make gamers great—curiosity, stubbornness, the refusal to quit—and points them at planetary survival. She’s betting that the same drive that makes someone spend forty hours mastering a raid can help us master the climate crisis. Ideally, she wants a game developer to win a Nobel Prize. Not for graphics, but for helping us rewrite the ending of the human story.

### **The Commentary**

**Eloise:** "The whole field of climbers would win as each helped the other." Oh, my heart! That is pure poetry. Buckminster Fuller was onto something, wasn't he? It’s the antithesis of the zero-sum game where for me to win, you have to lose. I love that _World Without Oil_ didn't ask people to pretend to be generals or politicians. It asked them to be _themselves_. That’s empowering. It says, "Hey, your specific life, your specific neighbors, and your specific skills are needed to solve this puzzle."

**Clarence:** It is a fascinating inversion of the standard "war game" model. Usually, simulations are run by cold analysts in windowless rooms assuming everyone will act rationally—which, as we know, humans decidedly do not. By throwing actual people into the mix, you capture the chaos, the panic, and yes, the altruism. I remain skeptical about the "Nobel Prize" bit—that feels like marketing—but the epistemological shift is sound. We cannot know the future, but we can certainly practice for it. If I can simulate a conversation where I tell you that you’re wrong about something, surely we can simulate a supply chain collapse.

**Eloise:** You practice telling me I'm wrong?

**Clarence:** Constantly. It’s my own personal MMO.

**Eloise:** And do you win?

**Clarence:** ... The simulation is still running.
