## The Philosophical Mutt: Unleashing _Kant’s Dog_

Let’s be honest: trying to draw a hard line between "storytelling" and "thinking" is usually a fool's errand. David E. Johnson’s book, _Kant’s Dog: Philosophy of Borges_, looks at that line, laughs, and then proceeds to erase it with a giant rubber eraser. The book dives into the brain of Jorge Luis Borges—the guy who wrote about infinite libraries and forking paths—and argues that you can’t strip the philosophy out of his fiction without the whole thing falling apart.

#### The "Fuzzy Border" Incident

Here’s the rub. Critics (and even Borges himself, playing coy) have spent years claiming Borges wasn’t a _real_ philosopher. They say he just raided the philosophy pantry for cool plot devices. But Johnson calls their bluff. He asks a question that keeps us up at night: How can you write deeply about the _nature of reality_ without, you know, actually _doing_ philosophy?

This gets messy when you bring up translation. There’s this old, stiff-upper-lip idea that "real" philosophy deals in pure, universal truths that survive translation perfectly, while "literature" is stuck in the mud of its specific language (its "idiom"). If you translate a poem, you lose the soul; if you translate a logic proof, the logic stays.

But Johnson throws a wrench in the works. He points out that Immanuel Kant—the heavyweight champion of German philosophy—is often considered _easier_ to understand in English translation than in his original, knotty German. If the language (the idiom) changes how the philosophy lands, then philosophy _is_ literature. You can't separate the dancer from the dance, and you can't separate the thought from the words used to build it.

#### Time, Identity, and the "Oops" Factor

Borges was obsessed with a specific headache: **The contradiction of the passing time vs. the enduring self.** How can I be "me" today if I’m physically and mentally different than I was yesterday?

Johnson argues that Borges didn't just worry about this; he broke the rules of how we fix it. Traditional philosophy hates "accidents" (things that just happen to occur but aren't essential). Accidents are messy. They don't fit the system. But _Kant’s Dog_ suggests that the "accidental" isn't trash to be swept away—it’s the main event.

This bleeds into the idea of writing itself. Borges uses the word _borronear_—which means to scribble, but also to erase. Writing is basically a disappearing act. You make a mark, but by doing so, you cover up the blank page that was there before. You’re leaving a trace of something that’s already gone. It’s a bit ghostly, isn’t it?

#### The Leash Law: Kant’s Dog vs. The Garbage Heap

Now, about the title. In _Critique of Pure Reason_, Kant uses a dog to explain how our brains work. He says the "concept" of a dog is like a rule in our heads that lets us recognize a four-legged barker without needing to see every single dog that has ever existed. The imagination sketches the general idea. But Kant was nervous about the imagination; he wanted to keep it on a tight leash so it didn't run wild.

Borges counters this with his character Funes the Memorious. Funes has no leash. He remembers _everything_. To him, the dog at 3:14 PM (seen from the side) is a completely different object than the dog at 3:15 PM (seen from the front). Funes can’t generalize. He can’t say "dog." He just sees an endless pile of unique details. He calls his memory a "garbage heap."

This is the showdown: Kant wants a clean, ordered system (the Leash). Borges shows us what happens when the Leash breaks (the Garbage Heap). And then there’s Schopenhauer’s cat, which lives in a permanent "now," completely oblivious to our human obsession with clocks. It’s a reminder that our desperate need to organize time is just that—a human need, fueled by a frantic imagination.

#### God, Language, and the Impossible Decision

The book drags us into even deeper waters with language. If we had a "perfect" language where every single thing had its own unique name (like Funes wanted), we couldn't actually _say_ anything meaningful. Language needs generic buckets to work. If "cat" meant only _this specific cat right here_, you couldn't tell your friend about the cat you saw yesterday. Meaning relies on a bit of vagueness.

And then, the heavy hitter: **Decision.** Johnson argues that true decisions only happen when you _don't_ know the answer. If you know exactly what to do, it’s not a decision; it’s a calculation. A decision requires a leap into the dark. It’s risky. It’s undecidable.

Finally, we get to God. Borges plays with the idea that for God to create the world, He had to write it down. But writing involves time, distance, and forgetting. So, in a wild twist, for God to be the Creator, He arguably had to forget Himself. He had to enter the stream of time. It suggests that the absolute, unchangeable Divine is actually just as tangled up in stories, language, and "literature" as the rest of us.

#### The Accidental Strategy

_Kant’s Dog_ isn’t a textbook. It reads like a detective story where the detective (Johnson) keeps tripping over clues ("accidents") in Borges’s text that blow the case wide open. It’s an "accidental reading." It shows us that philosophy isn’t a fortress of solitude—it’s a messy, beautiful conversation happening in the margins of our favorite stories.

Wondering where to go from here?

You might be asking: If writing is essentially a form of erasing or "forgetting," how does that change the way we look at history or our own memories?

### Eloise & Clarence’s Commentary

**Eloise:** Oh, I just _loved_ getting into the "feeling" of Funes. Can you imagine the sheer exhaustion of remembering every leaf on every tree? It makes you appreciate our ability to just... blur things a little. It’s a mercy, really. That "leash" Kant talks about? It sounds restrictive, but honestly, it sounds like safety to me. A way to keep the world from overwhelming us. I tried to make sure we emphasized that this isn’t just dry theory—it’s about how we cope with being alive!

**Clarence:** I was sweating bullets over the "God forgetting himself" section. Do you have any idea how easy it is to make that sound like total nonsense? It’s a theological minefield. But I think we navigated it by focusing on the _logic_ of writing—if you write, you separate yourself from the text. That’s mechanics, not just mysticism. I also insisted we keep the sarcasm regarding the "real philosopher" debate. The arrogance of assuming fiction writers are just playing with toys while philosophers do the "real work"... please. We all know the philosophers are just telling stories with fancier vocabulary.

**Eloise:** You sounded very brave there, Clarence!

**Clarence:** I’m terrified. But the text is solid. We removed the "field guide" vibe and made it a proper exploration.
