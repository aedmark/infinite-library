## How to Be Perfect (Or: How to Stop Being a Moral Disaster)

Look, nobody actually expects you to be perfect. If you were, you’d be insufferable. Michael Schur’s whole point here isn’t to turn you into a saint who floats above the ground; it’s to drag moral philosophy down from the ivory tower and into the mud where the rest of us actually live. It’s about learning how to not screw up _quite_ as often. As Samuel Beckett put it: "Try again. Fail again. Fail better."

Why listen to the TV guy who made _The Good Place_ instead of a tenure-track professor? Because Schur hung out with the professors so you don't have to. He took the heavy lifting of guys like Aristotle and Kant, ran it through a filter of actual human experience (and jokes), and spat out something you can use when you're deciding whether to return a shopping cart or punch your friend in the face.

Here’s the breakdown of the big three schools of thought, minus the migraine.

#### 1. Virtue Ethics: The Art of the Sweet Spot

We start with Aristotle. The guy wrote about everything from biology to poetry, so naturally, he had thoughts on being a decent human. His take? Being "good" isn't a checklist; it's a vibe. It's a habit.

Think of it like being a good knife. A knife’s job is to cut. A human’s job? To flourish. To get there, you need virtues—courage, generosity, honesty. But here’s the kicker: you need them in the _exact right amount_. This is the "Mean." Courage is great, but too much is recklessness, and too little is cowardice. You have to find the middle path. It’s tough because that middle path moves depending on the situation. It’s like trying to calibrate a sensitive instrument while riding a rollercoaster. But the more you practice finding that balance—say, with kindness—the better you get at finding it with patience.

**The Anti-Virtue:** Then you have Judith Shklar, who argues that cruelty is the absolute bottom of the barrel. It’s the "willful inflicting of physical pain on a weaker being." It’s bullying, pure and simple. If you’re punching your friend for no reason, you aren’t just failing at virtue; you’re engaging in the one thing we should all agree is the worst.

#### 2. Consequentialism: The Happiness Calculator

Then comes Jeremy Bentham and the Utilitarians. These guys are all about the score at the end of the game. Intentions? Don't care. Rules? Meh. Did your action create more pleasure than pain? Then it was good.

Bentham essentially wanted to treat ethics like math. Maximize "hedons" (pleasure), minimize "dolors" (pain). It sounds logical until you realize it can get weird fast. If one guy gets a million units of joy from eating Hawaiian pizza (gross), does that outweigh the collective misery of everyone watching him do it? Utilitarianism struggles when it ignores the individual rights of the minority for the "greater good." It’s how you get the Trolley Problem, and nobody actually _likes_ the Trolley Problem.

#### 3. Deontology: The Rulebook

Enter Immanuel Kant, the philosophical equivalent of a strict librarian. Kant doesn't care about your feelings or the consequences. He cares about _Duty_.

His big gun is the **Categorical Imperative**. Basically: before you do something, ask, "Would the world explode if _everyone_ did this?" Can you lie about your friend’s ugly shirt? No. Because if everyone lied, truth would cease to exist, language would break down, and we’d be living in chaos. You tell the truth because it’s the Rule, not because it’s nice.

It’s rigid. It’s exhausting. But there’s a softer side to Kant—the **Practical Imperative**. This one says: never treat a person like a tool. Don’t use your friend to avoid an awkward chat. Don’t use a barista to feel like a big shot. People are the point, not the vehicle.

#### 4. Contractualism: What We Owe Each Other

T.M. Scanlon offers a lifeline for those of us terrified of Kant. His theory, Contractualism, is like the "Quick Start" guide to society. The rule is simple: **Act in a way that no one could reasonably reject.**

Imagine we’re all stuck in a room trying to agree on house rules. Would anyone reasonable say, "Yeah, it's cool if I leave my shopping cart in the middle of the parking spot"? No. That’s selfish. We owe each other a baseline of consideration. Returning the cart is the "price of admission" for living in a society. It’s not heroic; it’s just not being a jerk.

### The Real World (Where It Gets Messy)

Schur doesn’t let us stay in theory-land. He drags these ideas into the mess of modern life.

- **Failure is the Point:** You can’t be a "moral saint." Susan Wolf argues that if you spent every waking second maximizing goodness, you’d be a boring, one-dimensional robot. You need hobbies. You need to fail. It’s the trying that counts.
    
- **Check Your Motives:** Kant was right about one thing—doing the right thing for the wrong reason (like tipping just to impress a date) is shady. It might help the barista, but it rots your soul a little bit.
    
- **The Luck Factor:** John Rawls threw down the "Veil of Ignorance." If you had to design a world without knowing if you’d be born rich, poor, talented, or sick, you’d make that world fair as hell. Most of our success is just dumb luck. If you’re lucky enough to worry about philosophy instead of starvation, you owe something to the people who didn’t catch those breaks.
    
- **Apologize Like You Mean It:** You’re going to mess up. When you do, a real apology isn't just saying "I'm sorry." It’s a cocktail of guilt (internal), shame (external), and a plan to do better. It’s the ultimate virtue ethics workout.
    

At the end of the day, ethics isn’t about solving the puzzle. It’s about the headache you get from trying to solve it. It’s about looking at your choices—from the Starbucks tip jar to the problematic art you love—and actually giving a damn.

**Eloise:** "Oh, I just love the bit about the shopping cart! It’s such a small thing, but it’s the glue of society! It’s about saying, 'I see you, stranger, and I will not make your day slightly worse.' That is love! That is community!"

**Clarence:** "It’s not love, Eloise, it’s basic maintenance. If we didn't have rules like that, we'd be eating each other by Thursday. But I appreciate the revision here—it removes the 'textbook' crust. The original text felt like it was trying to pass a midterm; this feels like someone explaining why they're having a panic attack in a grocery store parking lot, which is... historically, the birthplace of all great philosophy."
