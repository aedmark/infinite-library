## The spiritual "Un-forgetting": A Look at _Secrets of Divine Love_

If you’ve ever felt like religion was a list of rules handed down by a distant, frowning principal, A. Helwa’s _Secrets of Divine Love_ is essentially walking into the principal’s office and realizing it was actually a lounge filled with pillows, tea, and your oldest friend waiting to give you a hug.

Helwa positions herself not as a scholar looking down from a high tower, but as a "flower picker." She’s just walking through the garden of Islamic theology, the Qur’an, and the poetry of mystics, gathering up the blooms that were already planted in the soil of your own soul. The central thesis here is simple but radical: Love isn't something God does on the weekends. Love is the physics of the spiritual universe. It is the _why_ behind the _what_.

#### The Paradox of Proximity

We often talk about "finding" God, as if the Creator is hiding behind a celestial couch. But the text argues that this is a geography problem. We assume separation because we can’t see the connection.

The Qur’an drops a heavy anchor here: God is closer to you than your **jugular vein**.

Stop and think about the anatomy of that. Your jugular is the lifeline delivering blood to your brain. If God is closer than that, then the Divine isn't just "near"; the Divine is the very medium of your existence. You are a fish frantically looking for water while swimming in the Pacific. We feel alone not because God left the building, but because the presence is so overwhelming and immediate that we become numb to it—like how you stop noticing the glasses sitting on your nose.

#### The Hot and Cold Taps of Reality

One of the trickiest parts of theology is reconciling a loving God with a world that often feels unfair. Helwa tackles this by looking at the interplay between **Mercy** (_Rahm_) and **Justice** (_Adl_).

Imagine the human heart is a clay mug.

- **Absolute Justice** is boiling water. Pour it in alone, and the mug cracks from the heat.
    
- **Absolute Mercy** is freezing water. Pour it in alone, and the mug shatters from the cold.
    

To sustain life, you need the warm, temperate mix. The universe operates on this blend. If reality were purely merciful, we’d have chaos without consequence. If it were purely just, none of us would survive our own mistakes. We exist in the habitable zone between the two.

However, the book makes a distinction between _Ar-Rahman_ (universal mercy, like the sun hitting both the rose and the weed) and _Ar-Rahim_ (specific mercy, which is the growth that happens when you actually open your leaves to that sun).

#### The Mirror Covered in Dust

So, who are you in this equation?

You aren't a mistake. You aren't a cosmic accident. The text defines the human soul as a bridge between Heaven and Earth. But here is the linguistic twist that Clarence absolutely loves: the Arabic word for human, _insan_, is tied to the word for "forgetfulness."

We aren't inherently evil; we are just amnesiacs.

We suffer from a spiritual dementia where we forget our own worth and our connection to the Source. The ego (_nafs_) isn’t a monster; it’s just a layer of steam on the mirror. When the spirit touches the heavy clay of the body, it creates this steam, fogging up the glass. We sin or mess up not because we are villains, but because we can’t see clearly through the fog. The journey of faith isn't about becoming someone new; it's a "spiritual undressing." You are taking off the layers of ego and distraction to reveal the masterpiece underneath.

#### The Toolkit for Remembrance

If the problem is forgetfulness, the solution is remembrance. The "Pillars of Islam" are reframed here not as taxes you pay to God, but as technologies for polishing that mirror.

- **Prayer (_Salat_):** Think of this less as a ritual and more as a charging station. Five times a day, you plug back into the Source to stop your battery from dying. It’s a moment to crumble the ego and admit, "Hey, I’m broken, and I need help."
    
- **Fasting (_Sawm_):** This is a voluntary "death" of the ego. By starving the body’s demands for a few hours, you turn up the volume on the spirit’s guidance.
    
- **Charity (_Zakat_):** This breaks the illusion that you own anything. You are just a pipe for water to flow through. If you block the pipe (hoard), the water goes stagnant. If you give, you stay fresh.
    
- **Pilgrimage (_Hajj_):** The ultimate act of dissolving the "Me" into the "Us."
    

#### Heaven is a State of Mind (Sort of)

The text leaves us with a lingering thought on the afterlife. Heaven and Hell aren't just zip codes you move to after you die. They begin right now.

Heaven is the state of total proximity—the removal of all veils between you and Love. Hell is the state of separation. But even in that separation, the fire is described as purifying. It burns away the false self so the real self can eventually emerge.

Ultimately, _Secrets of Divine Love_ asks you to stop trying to earn a love you already have. You don't buy sunlight; you just step out of the shade.

**Eloise:** Oh, I just _melt_ at the idea of the "spiritual undressing." It makes so much sense! We spend so much time putting on armor and masks to protect ourselves, but this is saying that the most beautiful thing is what’s underneath all that clunky metal. It’s terrified and vulnerable, sure, but it’s real. And the jugular vein image? Goosebumps. Absolute goosebumps. It makes you feel like you're never actually walking alone, even on your worst days.

**Clarence:** I admit, the etymology of _insan_ linking to forgetfulness rather than inherent sinfulness is a compelling philosophical pivot. It shifts the moral burden from "depravity" to "negligence." It suggests that the human condition is a cognitive failure rather than a moral one—we simply forget where we came from. Also, the mercy/justice thermal dynamics metaphor is surprisingly robust. Usually, theologians trip over themselves trying to explain theodicy, but "tempering the water" is a logical way to explain why we need boundaries alongside forgiveness.

**Whatever happened to the idea that fear is a good motivator?** If love is the soil, does that mean fear of punishment—which is a huge part of many religious traditions—is obsolete, or does it serve a different function in this "hot and cold" water mix?
