For a long time, the global philosophy club has been a bit exclusive. You had the Greeks, the Germans, the French, and the British drinking sherry in the lounge, while African philosophy was often kept in the hallway, labeled as "mythology" or "folk wisdom."

Marita Rainsborough’s analysis tells us that the hallway days are over. Contemporary African philosophy isn’t just knocking on the door; it’s remodeling the whole building. It is looking inward to figure out what it means to be African after colonialism, and outward to challenge the West on its own turf.

**The Vibe Shift: Intercultural vs. Transcultural**

First, let's sort out the methodology. There are two ways this dialogue is happening, and they are distinct.

**Intercultural Philosophy** is like a polite but firm dinner party. It assumes cultures are different, separate entities that need to talk to each other as equals. It’s about "fruitful friction." It says, "I have my truth, you have yours, let's trade."

**Transcultural Philosophy** is messier. It argues that the idea of a "pure" culture is a myth. We are all hybrids. It says culture isn't a box you live in; it's a river you swim in. It focuses on the mix—the "Third Space"—where new identities are forged.1

**The Elephant in the Seminar Room: Immanuel Kant**

Here is where it gets spicy. Immanuel Kant is the grandfather of Western modern philosophy. He gave us "Universalism" (the idea that logic applies to everyone) and the "Categorical Imperative" (moral duties).2

He also had some terrible, racist opinions about non-white people.

So, African philosophers have a complicated relationship with him. They are essentially doing a "hostile takeover" of his best ideas while firing his prejudices.

- **Kwasi Wiredu & Kwame Gyekye:** They look at Kant’s universalism and say, "Okay, logic is universal, sure. But you forgot something: People aren't just logic-machines; they are community members." They take Kant’s cold, hard reason and warm it up with **African Humanism**. Wiredu proposes "Sympathetic Impartiality"—we don't just judge based on dry rules; we judge based on human well-being.
    
- **Kwame Anthony Appiah:** He takes Kant’s "Cosmopolitanism" (being a citizen of the world) and grounds it. He calls it **"Rooted Cosmopolitanism."** You can care about the whole world, but you still love your hometown and your specific traditions. You don't have to be a generic "human" to be a global citizen.
    

**The Toolbox: Michel Foucault**

If Kant is the frenemy, Michel Foucault is the supplier of power tools. Foucault was obsessed with how knowledge _is_ power, and how defining something gives you control over it.3

- **Valentin Yves Mudimbe:** He uses Foucault to show how Europe "invented" Africa. For centuries, "Africa" wasn't treated as a real place with real history; it was a projection of European fears and desires—a "dark continent" created to make Europe feel "enlightened."4 Mudimbe is tearing down that library to see what’s actually underneath.5
    
- **Achille Mbembe:** He takes Foucault’s ideas about power and cranks the volume up to eleven. Foucault talked about "Biopolitics" (managing life).6 Mbembe introduces **"Necropolitics"**—the power to dictate who lives and who must die.7 In the post-colony, power isn't just about discipline; it's about the distribution of death. It is heavy, terrifying, and necessary work to understand how modern states operate.
    

**The Endgame: A New Humanism**

This isn't just academic gymnastics. Thinkers like **Odera Oruka** are fighting for a "human minimum"—the idea that before we talk about abstract rights, every human needs the basics to survive.8

The goal of all this? It’s not to destroy Western philosophy. It’s to expand it into a **World Philosophy**. By mixing African emphasis on community and memory with Western tools of critique, these thinkers are trying to build a table big enough for everyone—one where we don't just talk about justice, but actually practice it.

**Commentary from the Desk of Eloise & Clarence:**

**Clarence:** I feel personally attacked. Not by you, but by the situation. To embrace Kant’s _Critique of Pure Reason_ while having to ignore his anthropology is... it is a cognitive dissonance that gives me heartburn. But Wiredu’s "Sympathetic Impartiality" is a brilliant correction. It fixes the coldness. Kant treats humans like variables in an equation; Wiredu treats them like neighbors. It’s a necessary patch to the operating system.

**Eloise:** "Sympathetic Impartiality." I’m writing that on my arm. That’s it, isn't it? That’s the answer. We can be fair, but we don't have to be robots! And I love that you called it a "hostile takeover" of Kant. It’s like they walked into his house, rearranged the furniture, threw out the racist curtains, and said, "This is a nice house, we’re keeping it."

**Clarence:** It’s more of a renovation than a takeover. They are reinforcing the foundation because the original architect used some rotten wood.

**Eloise:** Rotten wood! Oh, Clarence, you’re getting feisty. I love it. But seriously, Mbembe’s "Necropolitics" gave me chills. It’s dark, but if we don't look at it, we can't fix it.

Next Step:

Mbembe’s concept of "Necropolitics" (the power to dictate who lives and dies) is intense.9 Would you like to see how this concept applies to modern issues like climate change refugees or healthcare access, to see if his theory predicts our current reality?
