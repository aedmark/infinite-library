## Empathy Is a Verb (And a Caulking Gun)

Here is the hard truth about "feeling": it’s cheap. You can sit on your couch, watch a documentary about a disaster halfway across the globe, and weep into your popcorn. That’s sympathy. It’s a mirror. You are feeling what they are feeling, or at least a fuzzy, low-resolution version of it.

But David Johnston argues that this isn’t enough. In fact, if you stop there, you haven’t actually done anything.

Johnston posits that empathy is a different beast entirely. It’s distinct from sympathy because it requires a shift in physics—moving from the passive state of "feeling with" to the active state of "understanding for." It’s about getting enough data on someone else’s reality to know exactly which lever to pull to make their life bearable. It’s not about crying with them; it’s about changing the tire while they cry.

**The Engineering of Care**

We tend to think of empathy as soft—a warm fuzzy thing for poets and therapists. But look at the history. The word itself is a young one in English, translated from the German _Einfühlung_, which was originally about projecting yourself into a piece of art to understand its structure.

When you apply that projection to humans, you get innovation. This is the wildest argument Johnston makes: Innovation is empathy in a hard hat. Think about it. Someone had to look at a person struggling to seal a window and think, "This is miserable. How do I fix the misery?" Boom: the caulking gun. The foghorn, the duck decoy, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—these are all technologies born from the same impulse. They require stepping outside your own ego to solve a problem that might not even be yours.

**The Second Mountain**

We spend the first half of our lives climbing the "First Mountain." This is the resume mountain. It’s about the job, the status, the acquisition of self. But Johnston suggests that the good stuff happens on the "Second Mountain." This is where you drop the ego and start climbing for others.

This isn’t just about being a "nice person." It’s about survival. Historically, humans didn't survive the pleistocene because we were the strongest (have you seen a bear?); we survived because we cooperated. We are wired for this.

**The Civic Gut Check**

This applies to the big machinery of society, too. In governance, empathy is the only thing that generates trust. If the state can’t "walk in the other person’s shoes"—a legal standard established in the Roncarelli case—then the law is just math with a gun.

This is especially critical when we talk about Indigenous relations. The principle of "Nothing about us without us" isn't a slogan; it’s an operational requirement. You cannot design policy for a community you haven't sat with, listened to, and learned from. It requires unlearning the arrogance of the "expert" and adopting the humility of the student.

**How to actually do it**

So, how do we stop being merely sympathetic observers? Johnston lays out a path that feels less like a to-do list and more like a rewiring of our daily habits:

- **Get smarter:** You can’t help if you don’t know how things work. Master a subject so you can be useful. Ignorance is a barrier to empathy.
    
- **Don't go it alone:** Individual heroism is overrated. Join the choir. Multilateral, interdisciplinary cooperation is how you tackle the big monsters like climate change.
    
- **The "Second Mountain" is mandatory:** Volunteer. Give blood. It’s the ultimate index of social solidarity because it’s a gift that literally keeps a stranger alive.
    
- **Invite everyone:** Diversity isn’t a quota; it’s a way to ensure you aren’t missing half the data. You need friction and different perspectives to find the truth.
    

We need to be a "smart and caring nation." That sounds like a greeting card, but break it down: Smart means having the wit to solve the problem. Caring means having the heart to know which problem needs solving. You need both. Otherwise, you’re just a smart person watching the world burn, or a caring person throwing water on an electrical fire.

**Commentary**

**Eloise:** Oh, I just love the "Second Mountain" imagery! It makes me want to lace up my hiking boots immediately. I insisted we keep the tone hopeful because, honestly, the original text felt a bit like a textbook summary, and empathy is so much more visceral than that! It’s a fire in the belly! I also really wanted to emphasize that being "smart" acts as a tool for the heart. It’s not enough to just want to help; you have to be _good_ at helping.

**Clarence:** I was primarily concerned with the distinction between sympathy and empathy. The original text drifted a bit, but we needed to nail down that one is passive and the other is active. I also fought to keep the German etymology (_Einfühlung_), even though Eloise thought it was "too nerdy," because words matter. If we don't understand the origin, we lose the nuance. Also, the idea that a caulking gun is an instrument of moral philosophy? That is simply delightful irony. I’m quite pleased we removed the repetitive "It isn't just X, but Y" structures. They were exhausting me.

**Eloise:** And we cut the "Tuesday" reference!

**Clarence:** Yes. No reductionist Tuesdays.

**What questions does this raise?**

If empathy is actually a form of rigorous data collection and problem-solving rather than just an emotion, how do we teach "empathy engineering" in schools alongside math and science?
