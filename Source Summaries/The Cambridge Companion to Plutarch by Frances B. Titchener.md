## The Original Life Coach: Unpacking Plutarch

If you think about it, Plutarch of Chaeronea was basically the ancient world's most prolific podcaster, except he wrote everything down and had a vocabulary that would make a dictionary blush. _The Cambridge Companion to Plutarch_ isn't a dry academic doorstop; it's an invitation to sit on the porch with a guy who wrote over a million words just trying to figure out how to be a decent human being.

#### The Man Who Wrote (Almost) Everything

To say Plutarch was hardworking is an understatement. The man produced a body of work twice the size of Plato’s. While we lost some of his tracks—RIP to his biography of Caligula, which would have been absolute fire—what we have left is staggering.

Most people know him for the _Parallel Lives_. You know the drill: he takes a Greek celebrity, pairs them with a Roman celebrity, and compares their stats.1 But he wasn't doing this for historical accuracy; he was doing it for _moral_ accuracy. He didn't care about dates and troop movements as much as he cared about character. He’d tell you about Nicias overspending on religious festivals or getting roasted by poets because _that’s_ where you see the man's soul. He treated history like a mirror, holding up these famous figures as _paradeigmata_ (examples) to ask: "See this guy?2 Do you want to end up like him? No? Then fix your attitude."

#### The _Moralia_: The "Everything Else" Drawer

But the _Companion_ argues that if you ignore his other massive collection, the _Moralia_, you’re missing the point. This collection of seventy-five essays is essentially a guide to navigating existence.

He covered everything. And I mean everything.

- **Need to behave at a funeral?** He’s got notes.
    
- **Dinner party etiquette?** Covered.
    
- **Thinking about becoming a vegetarian?** He wrote about the morality of eating meat.3
    
- **How to spot a fake friend?** See his essay on flatterers.
    

It’s in the _Moralia_ that we see Plutarch not just as a historian, but as a teacher, a philosopher, and a guy trying to "improve" his reader.

#### The "Macrotext" (Or: The Plutarch Cinematic Universe)

Here is where the _Companion_ gets really interesting. It suggests we shouldn't read these works in isolation. We need to view them as a "macrotext." Plutarch constantly remixed his own hits—using the same anecdotes in a biography that he used in a philosophical dialogue.

When you zoom out and look at the whole picture, you see the recurring themes:

1. **Paideia:** Education isn't just knowing facts; it's about shaping your soul.
    
2. **Balance:** Life is a wrestling match between your rational brain and your unruly emotions.
    
3. **Chill Out:** He was obsessed with warning people against _philotimia_ (competitive ambition) and anger.
    

But here’s the kicker: he wasn’t always consistent. The _Companion_ admits there are "formidable fault-lines" in his work. Was he a serious Platonist or a provider of common-sense advice? Was he prescriptive or open-ended? The answer is... yes. He was messy. He used dialogues where characters disagreed, leaving the reader to figure it out. He embraced "contrapuntal complexity."

#### The Viral Sensation of the Renaissance

The text traces how Plutarch went from a dusty shelf in the Byzantine East to the nightstand of every thinker in the Renaissance.

- **Byzantium:** Kept the lights on. Scholars like Photios and Metochites realized Plutarch was wise and preserved his work.
    
- **The West:** When he hit Europe, he exploded. Jacques Amyot translated him into French, telling kings that Plutarch would teach them the hard truths their courtiers were too scared to say.4
    
- **Montaigne:** The essayist basically admitted his work was built "entirely out of the spoils" of Plutarch. He loved that Plutarch’s work was "pieces not sewn together"—a mosaic of wisdom you could dip into anywhere.
    
- **Shakespeare:** Read North’s translation and essentially used it as a storyboard for his Roman plays.
    

In the end, Plutarch endorses the status quo of the Roman Empire, sure.5 But his real empire was the human mind. He created a space where philosophy wasn't just for the academy; it was for the dinner table.

**Clarence:** I have to say, the concept of the "macrotext" is deeply validating to me. We often demand that philosophers be perfectly consistent systems, like a computer code that compiles without errors.6 But Plutarch is more like a jazz musician riffing on a theme. He’s inconsistent? Good! _Humans_ are inconsistent. I love that the _Companion_ tells us to embrace the "fault-lines." Also, Montaigne saying he built his essays from Plutarch's "spoils" is the most honest thing a writer has ever said.7 We’re all just remixing the ancients, aren't we?

**Eloise:** I am obsessed with the fact that he wrote about how to spot a flatterer.8 That is timeless advice! It’s so comforting to know that people in the first century were dealing with the exact same social drama we deal with today. And the idea of the _Moralia_ covering everything from funerals to dinner parties? It makes him sound so... involved. He wasn’t just sitting in a cave thinking deep thoughts; he was out there living, eating, and trying to help his neighbors be better people. He sounds like the kind of neighbor who brings you a casserole and then stays for three hours to give you life advice—and you actually _want_ to listen.

**Since Plutarch used history essentially as a moral mood board (the _paradeigmata_), do you think we lose something when modern historians focus purely on "what happened" rather than "what it says about our character"? Is there a danger in returning to moralized history, or is it something we're actually starving for?**
