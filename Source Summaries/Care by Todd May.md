### The Heavy, messy Business of Giving a Damn: A Look at Todd May’s "Care"

Let’s get one thing straight: caring is terrifying.

Todd May’s book _Care_ isn’t just a dry academic walkthrough; it’s a mirror. It forces us to look at why we attach ourselves to things, people, and ideas that can—and eventually will—break our hearts. Caring isn’t just "valuing" something in the abstract. It’s distinct from needing (you need water, but you don't necessarily have an emotional relationship with the tap) and it’s certainly deeper than desiring (which is fleeting and often shallow).

Real caring binds you. It anchors you. If you care about your spouse, your local surf spot, or the abstract concept of justice, you are making yourself vulnerable. You are admitting that if these things are harmed, _you_ are harmed. You lose a piece of yourself. That vulnerability isn't a bug in the system; it's the defining feature.

**Head vs. Heart: The Grudge Match**

Philosophy loves a good fight, and here we have Harry Frankfurt vs. Agnieszka Jaworska.

Frankfurt is the "Head" guy. He argues that caring is a **reflective commitment**. It’s volitional. You look at your desires, pick the ones that matter, and sign a mental contract to uphold them. It’s deliberate. It’s about agency.

Jaworska, however, throws a wrench in that machinery. She points out that Frankfurt’s definition leaves out a lot of people—specifically young children or people with cognitive impairments like Alzheimer’s. Do they not care? Of course they do. She argues caring is grounded in **emotional engagement**. It’s not a one-time decision; it’s an "enduring pattern" of feeling. It’s a relationship with the world, not a checklist inside your brain.

**Why We Are What We Care About**

You can’t separate your identity from your cares. Without them, we’d just be "wantons"—drifting aimlessly on a sea of momentary impulses, eating a sandwich one minute and staring at a wall the next, with no thread connecting the two. Caring gives us a narrative. It structures our days. It tells us who we are.

Sometimes, it even tattles on us. You might say you don’t care about what people think, but if you spend an hour fixing your hair before the grocery store, your behavior is calling you a liar. Caring reveals the truth of us, even the parts we try to hide.

**The Feminist Revolution of Care Ethics**

For centuries, moral philosophy was dominated by "Generic Dudes" focusing on abstract principles, rules, and justice. It was cold. It was mathematical. Enter **Care Ethics**, a feminist approach that stopped pretending we are all isolated, rational robots.

Care ethics argues that relationality—the messy, sticky web of connections between people—is actually where morality lives. It challenges the old hierarchy that said "impartiality" was the highest good. Care ethics says, "Actually, it’s okay to prioritize your child over a stranger. That’s not a moral failure; that’s being human." It collapses the wall between the public and private spheres and insists that emotion is a valid form of moral intelligence.

**The Objects of Our Affection (and Obsession)**

We care about people, sure. But we also care about weird stuff. We care about ecosystems, math problems, and old watches that stopped working in 1974.

When we care about something "for its own sake," we are assigning it **inherent value**. We aren't using it to get something else; we just want it to _be_. Wonder is the signal flare here—if you look at a forest or a painting and just feel a sense of awe, you’re in the territory of inherent care.

**Can You Love Yourself Without Being a Jerk?**

Here’s where it gets tricky. Can you care for yourself? Frankfurt calls self-love the "purest" form of love, but May raises an eyebrow at that. Is it really "love," or is it just high-level maintenance?

May suggests reframing this as **self-care** (and not the bubble bath kind). It’s about identifying with your own caring nature. It’s about "caring that you care." To be a whole person, you have to take your own interests seriously—not in a selfish way, but in a way that respects the architecture of your own life.

**The Stoic Loophole**

Finally, May looks at the heavy hitters of detachment: Buddhism and Stoicism. Both philosophies offer a tempting deal: Keep the benevolence, keep the helpful actions, but ditch the suffering. They want you to engage with the world but remain invulnerable to the loss of it.

It sounds nice—caring without the risk of grief. But May asks the hard question: Is that actually caring? Or is it just a very polite form of dissociation? If you can’t be hurt when the thing you love is threatened, are you really loving it? May leaves us with the unsettling but beautiful conclusion that to be human is to accept the package deal: if you want the care, you have to take the ache that comes with it.

### Clarence & Eloise’s Edit Bay

**Eloise:** Oh, I got actual chills rewriting that last section. The idea that "ache" is the price of admission for being human? That is just... it’s everything! I think we really nailed the distinction between Frankfurt and Jaworska, too. Frankfurt feels so rigid, doesn't he? Like he wants to put love in a spreadsheet.

**Clarence:** Frankfurt isn't rigid; he’s precise. There is a danger in Jaworska’s approach—if we define care purely by emotion, then does my sudden, blinding rage at a traffic jam count as "caring" about the traffic? Probably not. We need _some_ reflection to distinguish a tantrum from a value. But, I will admit, the rewrite feels less like a lecture and more like a conversation. I particularly liked the bit about the "wantons." It paints a vivid picture of a life without anchors.

**Eloise:** I was worried we were being too mean to the Stoics, though! They’re just trying to help people not be sad!

**Clarence:** They’re trying to solve the equation of life by subtracting the variable of grief. It’s a valid mathematical move, but the result is... sterile. I think keeping the tone skeptical there was the right call. The text needed to feel like it had stakes.

**Eloise:** Totally. Also, "Generic Dudes" as a stand-in for traditional patriarchal ethics? _Chef's kiss._

**Clarence:** That was your addition. I would have said "Classical Rationalists," but I suppose your version gets the point across faster.

**What is the next logical question?**

If Stoicism and Care Ethics are at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum regarding vulnerability, is there a middle ground philosophy that allows for deep grief without total devastation?
