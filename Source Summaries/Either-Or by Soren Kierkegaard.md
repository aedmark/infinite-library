## The Ultimate Vibe Check: A Guide to Kierkegaard’s _Either/Or_

Let’s get one thing straight: _Either/Or_ isn’t a textbook. You don’t read it to memorize facts; you read it to get called out. Soren Kierkegaard didn’t write a dusty manual on how to think—he basically dumped a pile of fictional papers on a desk and said, "Here’s a mess. Figure out who you are."

The title gives away the game. It’s not "Both/And." It’s a fork in the road. The book forces you to look at two fundamentally different ways of existing and asks, with uncomfortable intensity: _Which one are you?_

#### Option A: The Aesthetic Life (The Chase)

Part One is written by a guy we simply call "A." Think of him as the ultimate curated persona. He’s witty, he’s bored, and he’s terrified of anything sticking.

This perspective is all about the immediate. It’s the "crop-dusting" approach to existence. You glide over experiences, extracting the fun, the beauty, and the interest, but you never land. You never commit.

- **The Goal:** To avoid boredom at all costs. To keep things interesting.
    
- **The Method:** "Rotation." You switch hobbies, lovers, and interests the moment they start to feel like work.
    
- **The Trap:** It sounds fun until you realize you’re building a house on quicksand. Because "A" lives entirely in the moment, he has no history and no future. He’s fractured. When the music stops, he falls apart. This pursuit of the "interesting" eventually backs him into a corner where the only thing left is a crushing, empty despair.
    

#### Option B: The Ethical Life (The Anchor)

Then we meet Judge Vilhelm in Part Two. If "A" is the guy you party with, Vilhelm is the guy who helps you move your couch on a Saturday morning.

Vilhelm writes letters to "A" telling him, effectively, to grow up. But not in a nagging way—in a "you are missing out on being a real person" way. To Vilhelm, the ethical life isn’t about following a boring list of rules. It’s about _becoming_ something.

- **The Goal:** To become yourself. To possess your own soul.
    
- **The Method:** Continuity. You accept your past, you commit to a future, and you show up for your life. You take a job, you get married, you have friends you don't ghost.
    
- **The Reality:** Vilhelm argues that freedom isn't doing whatever you want (that’s just being a slave to your impulses). True freedom is choosing to be responsible. It’s actively deciding to be the author of your own story, rather than just a character things happen to.
    

#### The Big Scary Pivot: The Choice

Here is where Kierkegaard stops being a writer and starts being a problem for your peace of mind. The book insists that you can’t drift from the Aesthetic to the Ethical. You can’t slide into it by accident.

You have to **choose**.

And we aren't talking about choosing a bagel flavor. Vilhelm argues that the most important choice isn't between "Good" and "Bad." It is the choice _to choose_ in the first place.

The Aesthetic person doesn't really choose; they just follow their mood. The Ethical person stops, looks at the options, and stakes their life on a direction. Vilhelm actually advises the young aesthete to "choose despair." Why? Because despair is honest. Despair is the moment you realize the party is empty. Once you hit that bottom, you can finally start building something real.

#### Why All the Masks?

Kierkegaard didn't put his name on the cover of these sections. He used pseudonyms (Victor Eremita, A, Judge Vilhelm). He did this to keep his hands clean, sure, but mostly to force _you_ to do the work.

If Kierkegaard just told you what to think, you’d nod and write it down. By using characters who disagree, he leaves you alone in the room with the arguments. He’s not the teacher; he’s the matchmaker setting you up with two different versions of your own soul.

#### The Context (Or: Kierkegaard’s messy breakup)

It helps to know that when he wrote this, Kierkegaard was going through it. He had just broken off an engagement to a woman named Regine Olsen. It was a massive scandal. In a way, he was living out this exact dilemma—choosing between a normal, ethical life of marriage (The Judge) and the solitary, melancholy life of a writer (The Aesthete).

He was also trying to throw a brick through the window of the popular philosophy of his day (Hegelianism), which loved to smooth over contradictions. Kierkegaard hated that. He wanted to remind people that life isn't a smooth system; it’s a jagged, terrifying, beautiful series of choices.

#### So, What Now?

There is no answer key at the back of _Either/Or_. Some people read it and think the Judge is a pompous bore. Others read it and think "A" is a tragic waste of potential.

That’s the point. The book is a mirror. If you stare into it and feel uncomfortable, that’s just the book working. It’s asking you to stop drifting, look at the two paths, and decide which version of existence you’re going to inhabit.

### Clarence & Eloise’s Commentary

**Eloise:** Oh, I just got absolute chills reworking that section on the Ethical life! The idea that "freedom is choosing to be responsible"? That is just... _chef's kiss_. It makes you realize that being a good friend or a dedicated partner isn't a cage, it's actually how you become real. I loved getting rid of the academic jargon there because, honestly, Judge Vilhelm is basically just that friend who really wants you to hydrate and pay your taxes because he loves you. It’s sweet!

**Clarence:** Sweet? It’s terrifying, Eloise. The section on "Choosing Despair" gave me palpitations. We had to be very careful with the tone there because it’s easy to make it sound like depression, but it’s more like... existential nausea? I think we struck the right balance. I particularly enjoyed removing the phrase "it's not just X, but Y." It’s lazy thinking. The reality is that Kierkegaard is trying to corner you. We needed the text to feel less like a lecture and more like an intervention.

**Eloise:** A loving intervention!

**Clarence:** A necessary one. Also, can we appreciate that we clarified the pseudonym thing? It’s not just "authorial distance," it’s a defense mechanism. The man was a mess. A brilliant mess.

**Eloise:** We are all brilliant messes, Clarence! That’s the point!

**Clarence:** Speak for yourself. I am a _cautious_ mess.

Next Step:

Would you like us to apply this same "Clarence & Eloise" treatment to Kierkegaard’s concept of the "Knight of Faith" from Fear and Trembling, or would you prefer to explore the historical reaction to Either/Or?
