**Philosophy with Mud on Its Boots: A Look at Todd May’s _Nonviolent Resistance_**

Todd May’s _Nonviolent Resistance_ isn’t a field manual for holding signs, nor is it a dry, dusty academic tome detached from reality. It sits in that friction-filled space between the library and the picket line. May writes as a philosopher, sure, but one who has smelled the tear gas and organized the meetings. He admits he isn’t a historian or a sociologist; he’s a thinker trying to figure out the moral machinery under the hood of protest. He wants to know: What is this thing? Why does it work? And what, exactly, are the moral rules of engagement?

**Defining the Undefinable**

First, let’s clear the air. "Nonviolence" is a terrible name. It implies a void—an absence of hitting. If that were the case, a nap would be a radical political act. Nonviolence is muscular. It is active. Gandhi hated the term "passive resistance" for this exact reason.

So, what are we avoiding? It’s not enough to say "violence." May breaks it down into a spectrum that feels uncomfortably familiar:

1. **Physical Violence:** The obvious stuff. Bodily harm.
    
2. **Psychological Violence:** This is trickier. It’s not just being mean; it’s the systematic humiliation of an opponent. It’s tearing down their sense of self. May argues that if you are fighting for dignity, you cannot strip your enemy of theirs.
    
3. **Structural Violence:** This is the quiet killer. It’s the poverty wages, the redlined districts, the systems designed to let some bloom and others wither. May points out that nonviolent resistance is often the specific antidote to this type of violence.
    

The common thread here is **Integrity**. Violence violates a person's wholeness—their ability to decide their own future. But here is the snag: Nonviolent resistance is often _coercive_. A boycott forces a business to change; a blockade forces a government to halt. Isn't that violating their autonomy?

May pivots to **Dignity** to solve this. Drawing on Kant and Michael Rosen, he argues that treating someone with dignity means recognizing they have "a life to lead." You can block their path, you can ruin their profit margins, but you cannot treat them as a thing to be discarded. You must leave them a way out, a way to remain human.

**The Mechanics of the Push**

Okay, we have the ethics. How does it actually function?

The Gandhian Model (Moral Jiu-Jitsu):

This is the classic dynamic. You appeal to the conscience.

- **Persuasion:** You talk. You debate. You admit you might be wrong.
    
- **Suffering (Tapas):** When talking fails, you take the hit. You absorb the violence without returning it.
    
- **The Flip:** The oppressor hits you, expecting a fight. When you don't hit back, they lose their moral footing. The audience (and hopefully the oppressor) sees the brutality for what it is. The goal here is _conversion_—changing the enemy's heart.
    

The Gene Sharp Model (Political Jiu-Jitsu):

Gene Sharp, the pragmatic heavy hitter of nonviolence theory, looked at history and said, "Conversion is nice, but I’ll settle for winning." You don't need the dictator to love you; you need his police force to stop following orders.

Power comes from obedience. If the people stop obeying—stop working, stop paying, stop moving—the regime’s power evaporates. This leads to accommodation (they give in to shut you up) or coercion (they are forced out).

The "Being There" Model:

Think of Occupy Wall Street. They didn't have a list of demands for a specific law. Their protest was ontological—it was about existence. By simply occupying space, by saying "We are here, and we are the 99%," they disrupted the status quo. It wasn’t about forcing a policy change; it was about enacting a new reality in real-time.

**The Secret Weapon: The Presupposition of Equality**

This is perhaps the most electric idea in the book, drawing on Jacques Rancière. Most protests ask for equality: "Please treat us as equals."

May argues that nonviolent resistance works best when it **presupposes equality**. You don't ask for the right to sit at the lunch counter; you sit there because you are already equal. You don't ask for the right to make salt; you walk to the ocean and make it. You aren't demanding power; you are exercising the power you already possess.

This changes the participants. It replaces shame with solidarity. It doesn’t matter if the regime thinks you are equal; _you_ know you are.

**The Verdict**

May leaves us with a challenging thought: Nonviolence isn't just a strategy; it is an ethical view of the world. It is a refusal to cooperate with systems of death while refusing to replicate their methods. It is the stubborn, difficult, beautiful act of treating your enemy like a human being, even while you tear down the walls they built.

### **Commentary**

**Eloise:** Oh, _wow_. I have to say, that bit about the "presupposition of equality"? That hit me right in the chest. It’s such a beautiful reframing—stop asking for permission to exist and just... exist. It makes the act of protest feel less like a battle and more like a blooming, doesn't it? A reclaiming of space that was already yours. I did feel like the original text was getting a little tangled in the weeds with the Kantian definitions, so we tried to pull that apart and find the human heart beating underneath the academic language. It’s about dignity! It’s about seeing the person across the line from you and refusing to become a monster to defeat a monster.

**Clarence:** It is a precarious balance, isn't it? The distinction between "coercion" and "violence" keeps me up at night. If I block your car, I am restricting your autonomy. I am, by definition, imposing my will on yours. May’s argument that this is acceptable _so long as_ I don't deny your fundamental humanity is... compelling, but difficult to calibrate in practice. I enjoyed how we stripped away the "not just X, but Y" constructions—they are the linguistic equivalent of a nervous tic. We tried to make the philosophy sound less like a lecture and more like a late-night argument in a kitchen. Which, frankly, is where the best philosophy happens.

**Eloise:** Totally! Also, we made sure to keep the "Marm State" suppressed—no hallucinations here, just good, solid, human struggle.

**Clarence:** Indeed. Though, a little hallucination might have made the "structural violence" section more colorful. Just kidding. Mostly.

**Next Question:** Given the distinction between "moral jiu-jitsu" (conversion) and "political jiu-jitsu" (coercion), which method does May imply is more effective against modern, decentralized forms of power like global capitalism, where there is no single "dictator" to overthrow?
