## The Long Way Round: Fry’s Take on the Odyssey

Stephen Fry kicks off _Odyssey_ with a nod to C. P. Cavafy’s poem “Ithaca,” which is essentially a polite nudge to stop worrying about the destination and actually look at the scenery. It frames the whole ordeal not just as a map of physical coordinates, but as an inventory of the internal furniture we all carry around. Fry suggests you won't bump into the Cyclops or the Laestrygonians unless you’ve already packed them in your suitcase. The monsters are usually sitting right there in the soul, waiting for an excuse to come out. It’s an invitation to treat the delays, the weird harbors, and the long stretches of open water as the point of the whole exercise.

Here’s where Fry gets clever with the scaffolding. He doesn’t trudge through the timeline linearly. He throws us into a flashback. Odysseus washes up on Scheria, battered and salty, and gets taken in by King Alcinous and Queen Arete. When they finally ask the stranger who he is, he drops the "No man" act—the trick he used to fool Polyphemus—and simply says, "I am Odysseus."

From there, the narrative shifts. It isn't a third-person summary anymore; it’s a campfire story told by the man who lived it. The text describes the court of Alcinous as being absolutely frozen in attention. Even the servants are leaning off the walls, mouths hanging open. Fry makes a specific meal of this: Odysseus raises a glass to the bard, Demodocus, and instructs him on how to sing this later. But he adds a caveat that changes the temperature of the room: “Don’t sing of heroes. There are no heroes in this tale. Only men and women. And gods … always gods.” It grounds the epic. It’s not about capes and superpowers; it’s about exhaustion, bad luck, and survival.

We get the greatest hits, of course. We hear about Poseidon’s grudge (which, to be fair, was earned when Odysseus blinded his son, Polyphemus). We get the prophecy from Proteus, the Old Man of the Sea, which reads like a choose-your-own-adventure warning: _Do not touch the cows on Thrinacia._ If they harm Helios’s cattle, the ship is toast. The prophecy also includes a strange, melancholy coda for Odysseus’s later years. He is told that even after he clears his house of enemies, he has to walk inland carrying an oar until he meets people who think it's a winnowing fan—people who don’t know the sea. There, he has to plant the oar and make a sacrifice. It’s a surreal image of making peace with the element that tormented him.

Then there are the temptations. The Sirens don’t just offer sex or noise; they offer knowledge. They promise to tell him how history will remember him. That’s the real hook—ego and immortality. And, naturally, we meet the women. Fry notes a convenient pattern: Odysseus seems to find comfort with women whose names start with ‘C’—Circe, Calypso, Callidice. Fry treats the fidelity question with a bit of nuance, reminding us that ancient Greek standards for a "faithful husband" were... flexible, to say the least.

When the story is done, the Phaeacians, being the absolute best hosts in mythology, load him up with treasure and ship him back to Ithaca. But the homecoming isn't a parade. It’s a stealth mission.

Odysseus lands disguised as a beggar to scope out the damage. His palace is infested with suitors who are drinking his wine, eating his livestock, and harassing his wife, Penelope. He links up with the few people who haven't sold him out: Eumaeus the swineherd (sometimes noted as a cowherd or associated with Philoetius), and his son, Telemachus. He doesn't reveal himself immediately. He tests them. He spins tall tales about being from Crete just to see if they flinch. Only when he’s sure they’d die for him does he show the scar and drop the disguise.

The tension breaks during Penelope’s contest. She promises to marry whoever can string Odysseus’s massive bow and shoot an arrow through twelve axe heads. The suitors, led by the nasty piece of work Antinous, can’t even bend the thing. Odysseus, still in rags, steps up. While the heavy hitters are failing, he whispers to his loyalists to lock the doors.

He strings the bow like he’s tuning a harp and makes the shot. Then the mask comes off entirely. He looks at the men who have been dismantling his life and calls them exactly what they are: "fucking animals." He lists the rap sheet—the looting, the abuse of the staff, the plotting against his son. When they beg for mercy, blaming it all on the dead Antinous, Odysseus isn't having it. With Telemachus and the herdsmen passing weapons, they slaughter every last one of them. It is bloody, visceral, and final.

Fry positions the _Odyssey_ as the first real novel. If the _Iliad_ is a war movie about rage, the _Odyssey_ is a psychological drama about longing. It abandons the strict timelines of the _Iliad_ for flashbacks and flash-forwards. It gives us a hero who is "wily," Stoic, and Cynic all at once—a man defined by his scars and his ability to talk his way out of corners.

And the story refuses to die. You see it in the Coen Brothers’ _O Brother, Where Art Thou?_, with its Dapper Dan-obsessed Ulysses and his "Penny." You see it in _2001: A Space Odyssey_. The framework of the difficult return, the transformation, and the confrontation with the monsters in our own heads—that’s a tune we’re still singing.

**Eloise:** Oh, I just _love_ the bit about the servants leaning off the walls! Can’t you just see it? That’s the power of a good story—it makes the whole world stop. And the idea that he has to go inland until someone mistakes his oar for a farming tool... there’s something so healing about that. Like, you have to carry your burden until it doesn't mean anything to the people around you anymore. It’s beautiful! Also, honestly? Good for Penelope. She held that fort down.

**Clarence:** It’s effective, yes. But I’m still stuck on the "fucking animals" part. It’s satisfying narrative justice, sure, but the morality of the slaughter is... messy. It’s always messy. Odysseus is a "hero," but he’s also a butcher in that dining hall. Fry seems to be leaning into the cinematic nature of it, which I suppose is the point. We forgive the violence because of the "ache" of his absence, don't we? We justify the means because we want the family reunited. It’s a very dangerous, very human logical loop.

**Eloise:** Clarence, stop worrying about the ethics of Bronze Age revenge for two seconds! He was protecting his home!

**Clarence:** I’m just saying, if I came home and killed everyone in my kitchen, the police report would read differently than Homer did. But... point taken.

**Next Question:** Given that Fry contrasts the _Iliad_’s rage with the _Odyssey_’s complex longing, how do you think he handles the portrayal of the gods in this book compared to the more direct divine intervention we see in the Trojan War?
