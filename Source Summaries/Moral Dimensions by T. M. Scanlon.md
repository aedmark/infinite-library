**The Anatomy of a Choice: A Walk Through Scanlon’s _Moral Dimensions_**

T.M. Scanlon’s _Moral Dimensions_ didn’t just pop out of thin air. It came from years of staring at the ceiling and wrestling with the "doctrine of double effect." You know the one: the idea that it’s somehow worse to _aim_ at a bad thing than to just watch it happen as a side effect of doing something good.

Scanlon admits he felt "intellectually whipsawed" by this. On one hand, the distinction feels right in your gut. On the other, he couldn't pin down _why_ your internal mental state should change whether an action is allowed or not. So, he took a scalpel to our moral concepts and sliced them into three distinct layers: Permissibility, Meaning, and Blame.

Here is what happens when you stop mixing them up.

**Dimension 1: Permissibility (Can I actually do this?)**

Permissibility asks a simple question: "May I?"

We usually assume that what we _intend_ to do changes the answer. Scanlon throws a wrench in that. He argues that intent is often just a smoke signal. It helps us guess what will happen—he calls this the **predictive significance of intent**—but it isn’t usually the thing that makes an act right or wrong.

What matters for permissibility are the facts on the ground. The effects. The rights involved.

He distinguishes between the **deliberative use** of principles (the rules you use to decide what to do) and the **critical use** (how we judge you after the fact). Permissibility lives in the deliberative zone. It’s about whether the action itself is licensed by principles we all have reason to accept. It is not about whether your heart was pure when you pulled the lever.

**Dimension 2: Meaning (What are you telling me?)**

This is where your reasons actually live. Independent of whether you _could_ do something, the reason _why_ you did it changes its "Meaning."

Scanlon’s favorite example is the phone call. If you call your sick relative because you love them, that has a specific meaning. If you call them because your mother threatened to write you out of the will if you didn’t, the act is physically identical. It is likely permissible in both cases. But the _meaning_ shifts from "I care about you" to "I care about my inheritance."

Meaning is the significance of the action for the agent and the people around them. It’s the data point that tells us who you are and what you value.

This is where we get the "Right Thing for the Wrong Reason" paradox. If you save a drowning person just to get your name in the paper, the act was permissible (you should save them!), but the meaning is selfish. We criticize you not because you broke a rule of action, but because your reasons reveal a defect in how you value other people.

**Dimension 3: Blame (The Relationship Adjustment)**

Here is where Scanlon gets radical. He dumps the old idea that blame is a punishment or a sanction. Instead, he looks at blame as a modification of a relationship.

To blame someone is to say: "Your actions showed me something about your attitude that impairs the relationship we can have."

We have a default "moral relationship" with everyone—a baseline of trust and regard. When someone acts with ill will, they damage that baseline. Blaming them isn’t about making them suffer; it’s about acknowledging that the relationship has changed. You downgrade your trust. You step back.

This leads to his spicy take on **Freedom**.

Philosophers have spent centuries arguing that you can’t blame someone unless they had "Free Will" to do otherwise. Scanlon shrugs this off. He argues that because blame isn’t a punishment, it doesn’t require that kind of metaphysical freedom. It only requires that your actions accurately reflect your attitudes. If you are a jerk, and your actions show you are a jerk, we are justified in adjusting our relationship with you, regardless of whether the universe determined you to be a jerk since the dawn of time.

**The Takeaway**

Scanlon isn't just splitting hairs; he’s cleaning up the mess in our heads. We often think someone is "bad" (Blame) so their action must be "illegal" (Permissibility). Or we think because an action had a good outcome, the person must be "virtuous" (Meaning).

By separating these, we get a clearer picture. You can do the right thing for the wrong reason. You can be blameworthy without deserving punishment. And you can understand the moral landscape not as a list of rules, but as a complex web of relationships that we are constantly tuning, breaking, and repairing.

### Commentary from the Desk

**Eloise:** "I am absolutely obsessed with his definition of blame! It takes the cruelty out of it, doesn't it? It stops being about 'I want you to hurt because you hurt me' and turns into 'I need to protect my heart because you showed me you aren't safe.' It’s so much more... human. And sad. But also, the bit about calling the sick relative? Oof. I felt that. It really is the _why_ that makes the world go round, not just the _what_."

**Clarence:** "I’m still sweating over the permissibility section. It’s uncomfortable to admit that motives don’t technically matter for the rules of action, but Scanlon is surgically precise there. We want to say 'bad intent = bad act,' but he’s right—that’s a category error. It’s 'bad intent = bad agent.' Also, notice how we avoided the 'ghost in the machine' stuff regarding free will? Scanlon dodges the metaphysical bullet by just redefining the target. Clever. Frustratingly clever."

Suggested Follow-Up:

"Since Scanlon separates the act from the agent's intent so sharply, how does he handle cases of attempted crimes where no harm actually occurs—is the act permissible even if the meaning is terrible?"
