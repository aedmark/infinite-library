**Atonement: More Than Just Avoiding the Gavel**

We humans love a silver bullet. We want the one simple trick, the single sentence that explains the entire universe, the "theory of everything" that fits on a bumper sticker. Adam J. Johnson suggests that when we try to do that with the Atonement—the massive, cosmic reality of what Christ actually _did_—we aren’t just oversimplifying; we’re missing out on the treasure.

Johnson’s main point here is that you can’t reduce the Atonement to a single "theory." It’s not just a courtroom drama (Penal Substitution), nor is it just a battlefield victory, nor just a moral example. It’s all of them, and then some. If you try to cut the whole doctrine with just one "handsaw"—say, focusing entirely on the legal side of things—you end up with a flat, one-dimensional God. And nobody needs that.

**The Trinity is the Engine**

You can’t talk about what Jesus did without talking about who God is. This is where people usually trip up. Johnson argues that the Atonement is a thoroughly Trinitarian event. It’s not the Father venting his anger on a reluctant Son. That’s a bad reading. Because God is One, there is zero conflict between the Father, Son, and Spirit. They are moving in perfect sync. The Cross isn't a dispute resolution within the Godhead; it’s the external expression of their internal, eternal love.

God’s attributes—his justice, holiness, and love—aren’t fighting for dominance. They’re all firing at once. But when those beautiful attributes run headfirst into human sin, they shift into an "alien mode." Holiness burns up impurity. Justice judges the unjust. But the goal isn’t the burning or the judging; the goal is the restoration.

**Salvation _For_, Not Just Salvation _From_**

This is the kicker. We spend so much time obsessing over what we are saved _from_ (sin, death, the devil, the bad place) that we forget what we are saved _for_. Johnson flips the script. The "No" God speaks to sin is wrapped inside a much louder "Yes" to creation.

We are saved _for_ abundant life. We are saved _for_ a restored relationship with the Triune God. It’s constructive. It’s about getting the band back together.

**The Cosmic Cleanup**

Also, this isn't just about you and your personal guilt. The scope is massive. Christ is the Creator, so his work touches everything—rocks, trees, angels, and yeah, even the demons (though that part is complicated and mostly about disarming them). Johnson brings up Irenaeus’s idea of "recapitulation," which is a fancy way of saying Jesus re-lived human history, but did it right this time, rewriting the code of humanity from the inside out.

And please, don't treat the Resurrection like an epilogue or a bonus track. It’s the main event. The Cross deals with the debt, but the Resurrection is the receipt. It’s the proof of the new creation starting _now_.

**The Bottom Line**

Stop trying to force the Atonement into a single box. It’s a diamond with a thousand facets. Penal Substitution is true, but it’s just one angle of the light. God didn’t just want to clear your record; He wanted to bring you—and the whole cosmos—home to the party.

### The Duo’s Take

**Eloise:** Oh, I just love this shift from "from" to "for"! It makes my heart do a little jump. We get so boggy, don't we? So stuck in the mud of "I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad," and we forget that the whole point of washing the mud off is so we can go dance in the living room! The idea that God’s "No" to sin is just a protective wrapper around his "Yes" to us... that’s the kind of public service I can get behind. It’s not just distinct legal paperwork; it’s a family reunion.

**Clarence:** I admit, I get nervous when people start tossing out established theological categories because they feel "mean," but Johnson seems to be doing the rigorous work here. He’s not discarding Penal Substitution; he’s contextualizing it. That’s a vital distinction. If you only have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail—and if you only have a juridical model of atonement, God starts to look exclusively like a litigator. My concern—and it’s always my concern—is that people will read "multifaceted" as "pick the one you like best and ignore the rest." You have to hold the tension. You have to look at the "alien mode" of wrath and not flinch, while admitting it serves the "native mode" of love. It’s messy, but accurate.

**Eloise:** See? You’re doing it again. Worrying about people getting it wrong.

**Clarence:** Someone has to. If we get the Trinity wrong, the whole thing collapses into child abuse or polytheism.

**Eloise:** But the _dance_, Clarence! Focus on the dance.

**Clarence:** I am focused on the choreography.

Logical Next Question:

Since the text mentions that divine attributes like wrath are an "alien mode" triggered by sin, how does Johnson suggest we reconcile the immutability of God (the idea that God doesn't change) with this emergence of a "new" reaction to human behavior?
