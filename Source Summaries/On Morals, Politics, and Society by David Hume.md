**David Hume: The Vibe Check of the Enlightenment**

David Hume sits at this weird, paradoxical table in history. He’s massive—like, you can’t do modern philosophy without tripping over him—but a lot of people think his political and moral stuff gets sidelined. The problem is that Hume didn’t just drop one bible and walk away. He wrote the _Treatise of Human Nature_ when he was basically a kid, and it was a total brick. Dense, provocative, and, in his own words, it "fell dead-born from the press." So, he spent the rest of his life doing a massive remix, releasing the _Enquiries_ and various essays to make his ideas actually readable.

If you want to get Hume, you have to look at the remix. Here is the download on what he was actually trying to say.

1. Your Brain is the Map, Your Heart is the Engine

Hume dropped a bomb on the rationalists: Reason is inert. It doesn’t do anything. You can know that a bus is hitting you (reason), but unless you care about not dying (sentiment/passion), you aren't going to move. In the Treatise, he famously said reason is the slave of the passions. Later, he softened it a bit, admitting that reason and sentiment work together—reason gives us the facts and consequences, but the actual moral verdict? The praise or the blame? That comes from how those facts make us feel.

2. The "Is-Ought" Guillotine

This is the big one. Hume noticed that writers love to rattle off a list of facts about the world (what is) and then magically jump to a conclusion about what we should do (what ought to be). Hume says you can’t do that. You can’t stack up a pile of "wood is flammable" and "fire is hot" to get to "you ought not to burn your neighbor’s house down" without sneaking in a hidden feeling—specifically, that burning your neighbor is a jerk move. There is no logical bridge from facts to morals without a sentiment crossing the gap.

3. If It Ain’t Useful, Trash It

Hume had zero patience for suffering. He categorized virtues into two buckets: stuff that is useful (to you or others) and stuff that is agreeable (to you or others). If a "virtue" doesn’t make life better or more pleasant, he called it a "monkish virtue"—things like self-denial, fasting, or penitence. If it doesn't help society and it doesn't make you happy, it’s not a virtue; it’s just neurosis.

4. Justice is a Human Invention (And That’s Okay)

This is where he gets really cool. Hume argues that justice isn’t written in the stars; it’s an "artificial" virtue. We invented it because we have two problems: limited generosity (we aren’t angels) and limited stuff (scarcity). If we loved everyone perfectly, or if iPhones grew on trees, we wouldn't need property laws. But since we are selfish and resources are tight, we slowly drifted into "conventions"—like driving on the right side of the road. We do it not because it’s Holy Law, but because we don’t want to crash.

5. We Didn’t Sign a Contract

Hume rolls his eyes at the idea of a "Social Contract." He points out that almost every government started with a guy with a big army taking over. We don’t obey the government because we promised to; we obey because the alternative is chaos. It’s all about utility. We stick with the program because the government keeps the peace, enforces those property rules, and stops us from killing each other.

6. The Realist

Hume wanted a "science of man." He was an empiricist, looking at politics through the lens of history and psychology, not wishful thinking. He didn’t want a utopia; he wanted a commercial society where people could trade, get rich, and be polite to each other. He’s a modernist who realized that civilization is fragile, held together by habit, reputation, and the mutual understanding that breaking the rules usually hurts us more than it helps us.

### Clarence & Eloise: Post-Mortem

**Eloise:** Okay, I just have to say, I am _obsessed_ with the "Monkish Virtues" thing. It’s so validating! Hume is basically saying, "Hey, if you’re making yourself miserable and it’s not helping anyone, stop calling it holy. You’re just being miserable." That is such a relief. It feels like permission to actually enjoy life and be useful to your community without all the self-flagellation. And the idea that justice comes from us just trying to figure out how to live together? It makes it feel so much more fragile and precious. It’s not a command from above; it’s a project we’re building together.

**Clarence:** See, that’s exactly what makes me nervous. It’s "precious," sure, but it’s also terrifying. If the only reason we don’t murder each other is "convention" and "utility," what happens when the utility calculus changes? Hume is brilliant, but the "Is-Ought" gap gives me an ulcer. He’s right—you can’t logically prove morality from facts—but that leaves us standing on a foundation of _vibes_. If our sentiments change, our morality changes. There’s no bedrock. It’s just us, floating on a raft of "this feels useful right now." That’s a heavy realization to have before noon.

**Eloise:** But that’s the beauty of it, Clarence! It means we _have_ to care. We can’t just rely on a rulebook; we have to actively cultivate sympathy.

**Clarence:** Or we just hope the "artificial virtues" hold up long enough for me to finish my coffee.

Next Logical Question:

Since Hume argues that justice is an "artificial" convention based on utility and scarcity, how would his philosophy handle a post-scarcity society (like in Star Trek) where the need for property laws might theoretically vanish?
