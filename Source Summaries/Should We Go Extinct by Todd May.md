### The Ultimate Cancellation: Todd May’s _Should We Go Extinct?_

It’s the kind of thought that usually hits you at 3:12 AM, right after you remember an embarrassing thing you said in high school: _Would the universe actually be better off if we just… weren't here?_

Todd May’s book, _Should We Go Extinct?_, takes that fleeting, morbid curiosity and treats it as a serious philosophical audit.1 This isn't about self-hatred or misanthropy. It’s a cold look at the balance sheet. On one side: Shakespeare, penicillin, and tacos. On the other side: factory farming, microplastics, and nuclear stockpiles.

May clarifies upfront that this isn't about _punishment_. We don't "deserve" to die out. The question is purely consequential: Given the astronomical suffering we cause to other animals and the planet, is our presence a net negative?

#### The "Clean" Exit

To answer this, we have to rule out the messy ways of dying.

- **Nuclear War:** If we go out in a blaze of glory, we take the dogs, the dolphins, and the trees with us. That defeats the purpose.
    
- **Solar Expansion:** The sun will eventually eat the Earth anyway, so that’s moot.2
    

May settles on the _Children of Men_ scenario (or the "infertility" model). Imagine we just stopped reproducing. No violence, no mass suicide (which May rules out as morally repugnant because it asks too much of living people). Just a quiet winding down. The last human turns off the lights. As May puts it: "No Fred, no foul." If Fred is never born, he isn't harmed by not existing.

#### The Defense: Why Stick Around?

Why should we fight to keep the species going? May walks through the best arguments for Team Human:

1. **The Happiness Quotient:** If most human lives are generally happy, then adding more humans adds more "value" to the universe. (Though this gets tricky—are we just creating more mediocre lives?)
    
2. **The Kantian Angle:** Humans have "reason" and "dignity."3 We are the only ones who can act morally. But May finds this argument a bit weak ("thin pickings"), because just _having_ the capacity for reason doesn't mean we use it well.
    
3. **The "Good-For" Argument:** Humans have a unique capacity to appreciate beauty, create art, and strive for a "good life." A universe without someone to appreciate a sunset or a symphony is an impoverished universe. We add a layer of depth—a "tragic loss" if it vanished.
    
4. **Meaning for Us:** Knowing there will be future generations gives _our_ lives meaning. If we knew we were the last ones, would we bother curing cancer or writing novels? Probably not.
    

#### The Prosecution: The Harms We Cause

This is where the book gets heavy. The primary argument against us isn't just climate change; it's **animal suffering**.

- **Factory Farming:** We inflict unimaginable pain on billions of animals annually.4 This isn't accidental; it's systematic.
    
- **The Balance:** Does the fact that we wrote _Don Quixote_ outweigh the suffering of billions of pigs and chickens in industrial cages? May suggests there is no common unit of measurement, but the sheer scale of the suffering makes it a "live question."
    
- **Ecosystems:** If nature has value _in itself_ (not just because it's useful to us), then we are the ultimate vandals.
    

#### The Verdict: A "Live Question"

May doesn’t give a hard "Yes" or "No." He concludes that the justification for our existence is currently… shaky. It’s a "live question."

However, we can try to _make_ ourselves justifiable. The book pivots from philosophy to a to-do list for survival:

1. **End Factory Farming:** This is non-negotiable. If we want to claim we are "good" for the planet, we have to stop torturing it for lunch.
    
2. **Reduce Population:** A smaller humanity (maybe 1 billion instead of 8) could preserve the "goods" (art, science, love) while drastically cutting the "bads" (pollution, suffering).
    
3. **Recognize Nature’s Value:** We need to stop seeing the world as a pantry and start seeing it as a neighbor.

### Eloise & Clarence: The Post-Mortem

**Eloise:** I have to say, the "No Fred, no foul" line made me laugh, but then it made me incredibly sad. The idea of the "tragic loss" really gets me. Sure, the trees would be fine without us, but there would be no one to write a poem about how green they are! Love, in that specific, messy, complicated human way, would just… vanish. That feels like a heavy price to pay just to save the squirrels some trouble.

**Clarence:** Eloise, you’re romanticizing it. The squirrels aren't just having "trouble"; they’re losing their habitats so we can build more strip malls. I found the factory farming argument impossible to ignore. We like to think of ourselves as these noble thinkers, like the figures in the "defense" section, but functionally, we are an industrial death machine for other species. If an alien species did to us what we do to cows, we’d call them monsters and demand their extinction immediately.

**Eloise:** But we can change! That’s the point of the end of the book. We have the _capacity_ to be better. That has to count for something.

**Clarence:** Capacity isn't the same as track record. May says it’s a "live question," which is polite philosopher speak for "we are currently failing the test." But I agree with the population point. Maybe we don't need to go extinct, we just need to… downsize. A lot.

**Next Logical Question:** May suggests that a "smaller" human population might be the ethical sweet spot, but how exactly do we get from 8 billion to 1 billion without draconian, dystopian government control or a catastrophic collapse? Is there an ethical roadmap for _shrinking_?
