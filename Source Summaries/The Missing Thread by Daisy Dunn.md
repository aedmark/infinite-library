## The Loom and the Labyrinth

History usually arrives on our doorstep wearing a suit of armor, smelling of horse sweat and old parchment, shouting about battles and borders. But Daisy Dunn’s _The Missing Thread_ suggests we’ve been staring at the armor and missing the person wearing it. Or, more accurately, we've missed the people weaving the tunic underneath. We are looking at a span of 3,000 years—from the bull-jumpers of Crete to the marble halls of the Julio-Claudians—not to sprinkle "women’s history" on top like a garnish, but to re-engineer the foundation.

Let’s drop anchor in Minoan Crete. The island is shaped like a cow, which is fitting because the place was obsessed with bulls. We’ve been told stories of King Minos and his pet monster, but the archaeology screams something different. Arthur Evans, the guy who dug up Knossos, desperately wanted to find a king. He found a chair and called it a throne; he found a building and called it a palace. But Knossos wasn't a royal residence; it was a civic engine—a massive, humming nervous system of workshops, granaries, and shrines.

Evans saw a labyrinth in the architecture, but he missed the point. The "labrys"—the double-axe—was everywhere, and it was almost always in the hands of women. This wasn't a kingdom of men; it was a matriarchal corporation. Women were the artisans, the potters, the weavers driving the economy. They were the ones holding the knife at the bull sacrifice.

While the Minoans were busy jumping over bulls, a woman in Sumer named Enheduanna was busy inventing the concept of "The Author." She is the first person in recorded history—male or female—to attach a name to a piece of writing. She was a high priestess, the daughter of Sargon, but she didn’t rest on daddy’s laurels. She wrote hymns that sounded like thunderstorms. When she was assaulted and cast out, she didn't just weep; she wrote a curse so potent we’re still reading it 4,000 years later. She looked at the void of anonymity and said, "No. I am here."

Fast forward to the Mycenaeans. They were the rougher, tougher cousins who took over the Aegean. Their writing, Linear B, isn't poetry; it’s accounting. But oh, the secrets in those ledgers. We have clay tablets listing thousands of women—flax-workers, spinners, bath-attendants. And get this: the payroll records show equal rations for men and women. In a world that often starved its daughters, the Mycenaeans valued the labor, regardless of who performed it.

Then comes the crash. The Bronze Age collapses, the lights go out, and we wake up in the Iron Age with Homer. Or do we? The _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_ are the bedrock of Western literature, but the sand is shifting under them. There is a quiet, persistent theory—whispered by Samuel Butler, shouted by Robert Graves—that the _Odyssey_ feels... different. Domestic. The mistakes regarding sailing and geography feel like they belong to someone who lived inland, or perhaps, someone who lived in a court. Someone like a woman. Phantasia? Nausicaa? It’s a lovely, unprovable thought. But the text reveres weaving as a form of intelligence. Penelope isn’t just waiting; she is rewriting time with her loom, unmaking the shroud to keep the suitors at bay.

If Homer is a ghost, Sappho is a lightning strike. She lived on Lesbos, ran a finishing school (or a cult of personality, depending on who you ask), and wrote poetry that makes modern pop songs look emotionally stunted. She was competitive, she was vicious, and she was desperate for _kleos_—glory. She taunted her rivals with the worst curse imaginable: oblivion. "When you die," she told them, "no one will remember your name." She made sure we remembered hers.

Politics was never a "men only" club; men just wrote the bylaws. In Delphi, the Pythia—a post-menopausal woman sitting on a tripod, inhaling vapors—held the fate of empires in her lungs. Kings didn't move without her nod. And in Sparta, Queen Gorgo was outsmarting everyone. When a blank wax tablet arrived, the men stared at it like confused puppies. Gorgo scraped off the wax to find the warning carved into the wood underneath: the Persians are coming.

Speaking of Persians, the Achaemenid Empire was run by women who would eat Roman senators for breakfast. Atossa, daughter of Cyrus, had her hand on the wheel of state. She had her own money, her own administration, and she arguably invented the reconnaissance mission.

Then we have Rome. The Romans loved a good moralizing story, usually involving a dead woman. The Republic was built on the corpse of Lucretia. Her suicide after being raped wasn't just a tragedy; it was the political catalyst that ousted the kings. It’s a grim pattern: women’s pain as the mortar for men’s liberty.

But Roman women hit back. Fulvia ran Rome while Mark Antony was off playing soldier. She raised armies. She wore a sword. The historians hated her for it—they called her "manly" as if courage required testicles. And Livia? Augustus might have been the Emperor, but Livia was the administration. She was the "Romana Princeps," the first lady who filtered the world for her husband. She saved lives, she destroyed enemies, and she stayed standing.

The history of antiquity isn't a list of battles. It’s a tapestry. And if you pull the thread labeled "Woman," the whole thing doesn't unravel—it tightens. It finally makes sense.

### Eloise & Clarence’s Post-Mortem

**Eloise:** Oh, this one hit me right in the chest. That line about Enheduanna? "No. I am here." I got chills! It’s so easy to think of history as this dusty, silent movie, but these women were _screaming_ to be heard. And the Mycenaean payroll! Equal rations! It makes you realize that "progress" isn't a straight line. We had it, we lost it, we fought for it again. It’s heartbreaking, but also... hopeful?

**Clarence:** Hopeful is a stretch, El. I’d say "revelatory." I appreciate that we didn't fall into the trap of idealizing the Minoans as some peaceful hippie commune—they were sacrificing bulls and running a massive industrial complex. And I love the skepticism around Homer. It doesn't matter if a woman wrote the _Odyssey_, but the fact that the text allows for the _possibility_ says everything about the female intellect of the time. Also, Fulvia wearing a sword? That’s not "manly," that’s just practical management when your husband is an idiot.

**Eloise:** Clarence! Mark Antony was... well, okay, he was a bit of a mess. But I love how weaving is reframed here. It’s not just "women’s work." It’s coding. It’s storytelling. It’s controlling the narrative.

**Clarence:** Precisely. History is just a loom where the winners pick the colors. Daisy Dunn—and this revision—just reminded us to look at the backside of the rug to see how the knots are tied.

**Next Logical Question:** Considering the power wielded by figures like Livia and the Pythia, how did the legal rights of common women in Rome compare to those in the "women-revering" Minoan society, specifically regarding property and divorce?
