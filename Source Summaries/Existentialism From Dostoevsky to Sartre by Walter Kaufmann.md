## The "I Hate This Label" Club: A Guide to Existentialism

Walter Kaufmann’s _Existentialism: From Dostoevsky to Sartre_ admits the funny truth right out of the gate: "Existentialism" is basically a sticker we slapped on a group of philosophers who mostly couldn't stand each other.

If you tried to get Jaspers, Heidegger, and Sartre in a room for a group photo, you’d end up with a fistfight. The only thing tying this dysfunctional family together is a shared allergy to traditional, academic philosophy. They all looked at the neat, logical systems of the past—where everything fits into a perfect mental box—and said, "Have you met a human being? We are a mess."

Existentialism isn't a doctrine. It’s a revolt. It’s the philosophy of the specific, sweating, anxious individual standing against the "System."

**The Cast of Anti-Heroes**

Kaufmann treats this not as a textbook, but as a narrative arc. It’s a story about the "dreadful freedom" of being alive.

- **Dostoevsky (The Overture):** We start underground. Specifically, with the "Underground Man" from _Notes from Underground_. This character is the patron saint of overthinking. He is spiteful, sick, and refuses to be "fixed" by society or reason. He argues that humans don't want to be happy; they want to be _independent_, even if it means destroying themselves. He creates a problem that the rest of the book tries to solve.
    
- **Kierkegaard (The Individual):** While everyone else was trying to make life easier with science and logic, Kierkegaard decided his job was "to create difficulties everywhere." He felt we were sleepwalking through life. He championed "The Individual" against the crowd. For him, the self isn't a thing you _have_; it's a decision you make in "fear and trembling."
    
- **Nietzsche (The Dynamite):** You can't have this conversation without him. He announced the death of God, not as a victory, but as a terrifying catastrophe that left us alone in a cold universe. He smashed the old tables of values and told us we had to carve our own. He is the terrifying uncle of the movement.
    
- **Jaspers (The Spark):** Karl Jaspers hated the term "existentialism." He preferred _Existenzphilosophie_. He realized you can't summarize a human life like a book report. His goal wasn't to teach you a new set of rules, but to "kindle a fire" in your brain so you’d stop accepting easy answers.
    
- **Heidegger (The "Being" Guy):** Here is the giant, problematic figure. He wrote _Being and Time_, arguably the heavy-lifting manual of the genre, yet he rejected the label entirely. He thought Sartre (below) ruined everything by turning philosophy into psychology. Heidegger was obsessed with "Being" with a capital B. He also joined the Nazi party, which puts a massive, dark asterisk next to his talk of "authenticity."1
    
- Sartre (The PR Manager): Jean-Paul Sartre is the reason you know the word "Existentialism." He took these difficult ideas and put them on the front page. His big hook? Existence precedes Essence.
    
    This sounds fancy, but it just means: You are a blank slate. There is no "human nature" or "God's plan" that defines you before you are born. You exist first, and then you define who you are by what you do.2
    
    This is terrifying because it means you have zero excuses. You are responsible for everything. If you are a coward, it’s not because you were born with "coward DNA"; it’s because you chose cowardice this morning. Sartre calls this "monstrous freedom."
    

**The Half-Socrates**

Kaufmann ends on a sobering note. He suggests that modern philosophy has split into two boring camps. On one side, you have the analytical philosophers (the logic nerds) who are precise but discuss trivial things.3 On the other, you have the existentialists who tackle the huge, bloody problems of life but can be messy and vague.

Socrates combined both—passion and logic. Today, Kaufmann says, we are all just "Half a Socrates." The goal is to stitch the two halves back together: to think clearly, but about things that actually matter.

**Commentary**

**Eloise:** I have to say, the idea of "creating difficulties everywhere" resonates with me! We spend so much time trying to hack our lives for comfort, but Kierkegaard is right—the friction is where the life happens! I also appreciate that Sartre refuses to let us off the hook. It’s so empowering! Scary, yes, but empowering. You aren’t a victim of your personality; you _are_ your choices. It makes me want to choose better things immediately.

**Clarence:** I find the inclusion of Heidegger the most challenging part of this intellectual lineage. It is a stark reminder that you can be a genius about "Being" and a moral failure about "Living." I also appreciate Kaufmann’s critique of the "Half a Socrates." We see this everywhere—people who have data but no soul, or people who have "vibes" but no rigor. One without the other is useless. Also, Dostoevsky’s Underground Man is the most accurate depiction of internet comment sections ever written.

**Eloise:** Oh, totally. Pure spite.

**Clarence:** Pure, unadulterated, irrational spite.

**What questions does this raise?**

If "existence precedes essence" and we are entirely responsible for who we become, how do existentialists account for systemic oppression or biological limitations that physically prevent certain choices?
