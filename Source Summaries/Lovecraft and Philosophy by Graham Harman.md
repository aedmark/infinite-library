## The Horror of the Unsayable: Why Lovecraft is Philosophy’s Weird Uncle

Let’s be real for a second: Howard Phillips Lovecraft was a strange guy. He was terrified of practically everything—cold weather, seafood, math, people who didn't look like him. But Graham Harman, the contemporary philosopher who practically invented Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO), looked at this shivering, xenophobic writer and saw something brilliant. He saw a "tacit philosopher."

Harman makes a bold play here. He suggests that just as Heidegger plucked the poet Hölderlin to explain the nature of being, modern philosophy should be looking at Lovecraft. Why? Because Lovecraft understood that the universe doesn't owe us an explanation. Harman even jokes that Miskatonic University should be the new Ivy League for thinkers and that we should swap out Minerva’s owl for Cthulhu.

### The Problem with Paraphrasing (Or, Why Edmund Wilson Was Wrong)

There’s this literary critic, Edmund Wilson, who famously dunked on Lovecraft. Wilson looked at a story like _The Call of Cthulhu_ and essentially said, "Big deal. It’s just a giant octopus-dragon."

Harman thinks this is lazy. He calls it the "paraphrase" trap. If you reduce Dante’s _Inferno_ to "a mid-life crisis Italian guy hikes through a fire pit to see his dead girlfriend," you’ve missed the point of the poetry. You’ve stripped the meat off the bone and complained that the skeleton isn't very cuddly. Harman argues that Lovecraft’s power isn’t in the _monster_ itself, but in the _style_—specifically, how Lovecraft breaks language to show us that the monster can’t be described at all.

Lovecraft is a "productionist." He doesn't just describe a thing; he builds a gap in your brain where the description should be.

### Mind the Gaps: The Ontography of Terror

Harman breaks this down into what he calls "ontography"—a fancy way of mapping the tension between objects and their qualities. He finds two main ways Lovecraft messes with our heads:

#### 1. The Vertical Gap (The "Space" Tension)

Imagine an object that refuses to be known. This is the **Real Object (RO)** vs. its **Sensual Qualities (SQ)**.

In philosophy, this is the Kantian "thing-in-itself"—the reality that exists regardless of whether we are looking at it. Lovecraft loves this. He’ll tell you about an idol of Cthulhu, listing parts like "octopus," "dragon," and "human," but then he pulls the rug out. He says the "general outline of the whole" is what makes it horrifying. The list of parts doesn't add up to the whole. The object is withdrawn; it’s hiding behind its own description.

Lovecraft creates a "vertical" rift between what a thing _is_ and what we can _say_ about it. He hints at geometries that are "all wrong," violating our basic logic without ever handing us a blueprint. It’s the horror of a reality that is fundamentally incompatible with our brains.

#### 2. The Horizontal Gap (The "Time" Tension)

This is the opposite problem. The object isn't hiding; it’s exploding with _too much_ information. This is the **Sensual Object (SO)** vs. **Sensual Qualities (SQ)**.

Harman compares this to Cubist painting. You know how Picasso would paint a face from five different angles at once? Lovecraft does that with monsters. Look at Wilbur Whateley. He’s not just a mutant; he’s a reptilian, hairy, tentacled, hoofed, clawed mess all at once. Or the Antarctic city in _At the Mountains of Madness_, which is a pile-up of cones, cylinders, and scalloped discs.

The object is right there, but it’s overloaded with so many contradictory surfaces and textures that you can't unify them into a single image. It’s sensory overload as a weapon.

### The Weird Science of Essence and Eidos

Harman also identifies two rarer, deeper cuts in Lovecraft’s catalog:

- **The Black Box (RO-RQ):** Sometimes, both the object and its qualities are totally locked away. Think of the "Colour Out of Space." Scientists test it with every tool they have, and it fails every test. It’s a "blind idiot god" situation—pure nuclear chaos that we can’t even begin to measure.
    
- **The Glitch (SO-RQ):** This is when you have an object right in front of you (a Sensual Object), but its properties break the laws of physics (Real Qualities). Like the statue in _The Dreams in the Witch House_ that physically exists in the room but has geometry that shouldn't be possible in our dimension. It’s a tangible impossibility.
    

### The Stylistic Toolkit

Lovecraft pulls this off by being a master of "innuendo." He constantly undercuts his own narrators. He’ll have a character say a description is "trite" or "not quite right," which forces the reader to imagine something worse than what’s on the page.

He weaponizes naivety. His narrators are often skeptics or just plain slow on the uptake (bless their hearts). They see a fish-man and think "weird local condition." This forces us, the readers, to do the horrific math ourselves. We scream, "It’s a monster, you idiot!" while the narrator talks about "strangely poetic" architecture. It creates a rift between the character's experience and the reader's realization, making the horror feel like a secret we’ve uncovered rather than a jump scare.

### Why It Matters

Harman is telling us that Lovecraft isn't just writing pulp fiction; he’s building "philosophical machines." By destroying our ability to paraphrase or describe reality, Lovecraft shows us that the world is weird, autonomous, and totally indifferent to us.

Weird realism admits that reality is "incommensurable" with our attempts to measure it. The only way to get close to the truth is through illusion, hint, and shadow. Lovecraft doesn't scare us with what he shows us; he scares us with what he proves we can never truly see.

### Eloise & Clarence’s Commentary

**Clarence:** I have to say, the vindication of "style over content" is incredibly satisfying here. Everyone tries to read philosophy like it's an instruction manual—A leads to B leads to C. But Harman points out that Lovecraft treats reality like a knot you can't untie. The "Vertical Gap" is particularly anxiety-inducing for me. It’s the ultimate confirmation that no matter how hard I study, the "Thing-In-Itself" is always going to be laughing at me from the other side of the room. Also, Edmund Wilson sounds like the kind of guy who corrects people's grammar at funerals.

**Eloise:** Oh, stop it, Clarence. Wilson just wanted clarity! But I think what’s so beautiful about this—yes, beautiful!—is the vulnerability. Lovecraft’s narrators are so small. They’re trying so hard to use their little scientific rulers to measure infinite chaos. There’s a profound "ache" in that failure. It’s not just scary; it’s tragic. We try to name the world to make it safe, and Lovecraft just whispers, "Honey, you can't name this." It makes me want to hug the narrators. Well, maybe not Wilbur Whateley.

**Clarence:** Definitely not Wilbur. Too many textures. That "Horizontal Gap" is a sensory nightmare.

**Eloise:** Exactly! It’s overwhelming. But that’s the human experience, isn’t it? Being overwhelmed by the sheer _muchness_ of the world. Harman turning that into a philosophical system is actually really validating.

Logical Next Step:

Considering Harman links Lovecraft to Husserl and the idea of "adumbrations" (profiles), how would an Object-Oriented Philosopher analyze a more modern piece of "weird" media, like the film Annihilation or the game Control, where the environment itself seems to be a shifting, withdrawing object?
