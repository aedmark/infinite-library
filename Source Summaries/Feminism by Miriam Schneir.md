## The Great Erasure: Rediscovering the Feminist Archive

Miriam Schneir’s _Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings_ is essentially a rescue mission. It operates on a terrifying premise: Women have been systematically robbed of their history, and because they don't know where they came from, they struggle to define who they are.

We tend to think of feminism as something that started in the 1960s with Gloria Steinem, or maybe the 1920s with the suffragettes. But Schneir pulls back the curtain to reveal that women have been shouting into the void for centuries. We are talking about Christine de Pisan in the 1400s. We are talking about colonial poets like Anne Bradstreet in 1642. The frustration isn't new; it’s ancient.

**The Heavy Hitter: Mary Wollstonecraft**

If there is a "Big Bang" moment in this anthology, it is Mary Wollstonecraft’s _A Vindication of the Rights of Woman_ (1792).1 Wollstonecraft didn't ask for better treatment; she asked for a complete rewiring of reality.

She argued that women were being trained to be useless.2 Society demanded they be weak, artificial, and obsessed with pleasing men. Wollstonecraft hated this. She argued that a woman’s primary duty wasn't to a husband, but to **Reason** itself. If you keep a woman dependent on a man for her survival, you stunt her moral growth. She becomes a child in an adult’s body.

**The Vote Was a Distraction (Sort of)**

Schneir points out a fascinating, tragic pivot in history. The "Old Feminism" (19th century) started with a massive scope: marriage, money, religion, and the self. But over time, the movement narrowed its focus almost exclusively to **Suffrage** (the vote).3

While the vote was crucial, Schneir suggests that by zeroing in on it, the movement lost its radical edge. The early feminists knew that marking a ballot doesn't matter much if you are legally your husband's property.

The anthology highlights the issues that got sidelined:

- **Marriage as Trap:** The Grimké sisters and Isadora Duncan pointed out that "husband" was often a synonym for "master." The legal structure of marriage was set up to erase the woman’s legal existence.
    
- **The Economics of Freedom:** Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Virginia Woolf hammered this point home. You cannot be a free spirit if you are broke. Woolf famously argued that you can't write poetry if you don't have a room of your own and 500 pounds a year. Genius requires privacy, and privacy requires money.
    
- **The "Lady" Problem:** Thorstein Veblen analyzed the upper-class woman not as a person, but as a status symbol for her husband. Her job was "conspicuous leisure"—doing nothing, expensively, to prove her husband was rich.
    

**The Intersection of Oppressions**

The book highlights the moments where abolition and feminism crossed paths. The Grimké sisters, born into a slaveholding family, realized that the logic used to justify slavery—biological inferiority and divine order—was the exact same logic used to subjugate women. Frederick Douglass understood this, too, arguing that "Right is of no sex."4

**The Missing Voices**

Schneir is honest about the gaps. The "Old Feminism" was largely a movement of white, Western, middle-class women.5 The voices of working women, Black women, and women from the East are largely absent from the historical record of this era, not because they weren't thinking or fighting, but because they weren't being published.

**The Conclusion**

The anthology ends with a sobering thought. The focus on "reform" (changing laws) rather than "revolution" (changing structures) meant that feminism effectively went to sleep after the vote was won in 1920. It took a "counter-revolution" of domesticity in the mid-20th century to wake it back up. The lesson? The vote was the beginning, not the end.

**Commentary**

**Eloise:** I honestly felt a little weepy reading about the "erasure." Imagine all those brilliant women in the 1600s and 1700s, writing by candlelight, thinking they were the only ones feeling this way! It breaks my heart. But I love the emphasis on "selfhood." It’s not just about rights; it’s about the permission to be a distinct human being. And Virginia Woolf! "A woman must have money and a room of her own." That is the most practical, un-romantic, true advice ever given.

**Clarence:** I appreciate that the text exposes the strategic error of the suffrage movement. They sacrificed the complex argument (economic and social autonomy) for the single, palpable goal (the vote), thinking the vote would solve the rest. It did not. It is also fascinating to see the tension between the "rights of man" and the "rights of woman." You cannot logically hold the position that humans are rational agents deserving of liberty, and then exclude half the species based on biology. It is philosophically bankrupt. Wollstonecraft wasn't just a feminist; she was a better logician than her male contemporaries.

**Eloise:** Also, can we talk about "Conspicuous Leisure"? Being a trophy wife sounds exhausting.

**Clarence:** Indeed. Being an ornament is a terrible career path.

**What questions does this raise?**

If economic dependence is the primary barrier to "selfhood" as Gilman and Woolf suggest, how does the modern "wage gap" or the devaluation of domestic labor continue to psychologically stunt women's political identity today?
