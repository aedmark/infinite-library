## **Beyond Happiness:** Todd May's Guide to the 'Someway' of Living

---

Todd May’s _A Significant Life_ opens not with a grand thesis, but with a feeling of deep bewilderment. He recounts encountering an inscription at a museum: "One is born, one dies, the land increases."

Is that _all_? Is our existence just a brief interval before we return to the earth? This question—this central puzzle—becomes the driving force of his exploration.

May resists the immediate leap to absurdity or the universe's silence. He asks us to think more slowly. His hope isn't for some grand, revealed purpose, but for something more "pedestrian": a way to understand how a life can _become_ meaningful.

### Meaning: A "Something" or a "Someway"?

What are we looking for when we ask about life's meaning? May notes that we usually imagine a "something"—a feature built into the "furniture" of the universe, waiting to be found. This is Aristotle's _telos_, the thing Camus despaired of finding, and what many religious traditions see as a gift from God.

But, May proposes, what if this is the wrong way to ask? What if meaning isn't a "something" we discover, but a "someway" we live? Perhaps a meaningful life is simply one lived _in a certain way_ rather than another. This small shift in language is seismic: it moves meaning from a noun we possess to an adjective or adverb that describes our actions.

This, of course, raises two problems. First, one must define this "someway"—what values does it involve? Second, why would this self-generated meaningfulness "have a grip" on us? May isn't aiming for cosmic validation; he's looking for a perspective that allows us to _create_ meaningful lives, to make something worthwhile happen between birth and death.

### Happiness: Close, But Not Quite Meaning?

Is "meaning" just a code word for "happiness"? May argues it is not. While we have a right to pursue happiness, the two aren't identical. Saying "create your own meaning" can often sound like "decide what makes you happy," which feels thin. It lacks the "heft," the cosmic "redemption," we seem to crave from _meaning_.

May asks us to think slowly about happiness. Simple pleasure, even in our modern, abundant world, doesn't cut it. The "pleasure machine" thought experiment shows we value "life projects" and challenges, not just the passive pleasure they might bring.

Even richer views of happiness, like Daniel Haybron's "psychic affirmation" (a state of attunement, engagement, and endorsement), fall short. May concedes this is attractive, but it remains a layered _emotional relation_ to one's life. It still feels "too subjective." We seem to want ratification from a perspective that isn't just our own.

### Lives as Trajectories: Introducing Narrative Values

A human life, May observes, isn't a series of isolated moments. It’s a trajectory. It unfolds over time, and the question of meaning must apply to this _entire arc_.

This suggests a narrative approach: thinking of lives as stories. This isn't without problems—not everyone experiences life this way (he cites Galen Strawson’s "Episodic" self). The key, then, must be something _coiled inside_ the temporal character of life, something that can provide meaning without _requiring_ a narrative stance.

This brings May to his central concept: **narrative values**. These are themes that characterize a life's trajectory and, crucially, lend it a specific kind of value: meaningfulness. Unlike a theme like 'depression,' which adds no value, a narrative value like 'steadfastness' does.

He offers examples:

- **Steadfastness**: Seen in Faulkner's Dilsey, a Trappist monk, or the musician John Coltrane.
    
- **Intensity**: The way Jimi Hendrix threw himself into his music.
    

Other values he suggests include subtlety, adventurousness, integrity, spontaneity, and courage. These values describe _how_ a life is lived—its style or manner. A life can express them to varying degrees, and one doesn't need to consciously aim for a value to express it.

### Objective Attractiveness: Narrative Values vs. Subjectivity

May proposes these narrative values as the "objective attractiveness" we've been looking for, the component that balances subjective engagement.

He preempts the critique: Is this just subjectivity in disguise? No. These are _lived_ or _expressed_ ways of being, not just _felt_ experiences. Jimi Hendrix's intensity wasn't just a feeling; it was expressed in his actions.

This "objectivity" isn't some truth inscribed in the universe. It's something that emerges from our shared understanding, a "web of reasons" we can debate and refine.

### Meaning, Morality, and Other Values

May is careful to draw sharp distinctions. Meaningfulness is _not_ moral goodness. A person can be morally good but live a life impoverished in meaning (his example is Ralph Touchett). Conversely, a life can be meaningful and morally questionable (Lance Armstrong, pre-fall, with his intense, steadfast commitment). Meaning is not a "Get Out of Jail Free" card for moral failure.

Meaning is also _not_ success. Many of his examples (Dilsey, the monks) are not defined by wealth or fame. Meaning lies in the _how_, not the _what_. Nor is a life _lacking_ in meaning "worthless." It's more like aesthetic value: a meaningful life adds a kind of splendor, but it's not a moral obligation.

### Putting it Together: A Framework for Reflection

May's argument, then, is that meaningfulness is the intersection of two things: **subjective engagement** (being absorbed in your life) and **objective attractiveness** (living a life trajectory that expresses one or more narrative values).

Where these two meet, a life becomes meaningful.

It isn't a cosmic guarantee. It's a framework for reflection, a tool for finding a worthwhile path between birth and death.

---

A compelling and elegant argument. May has managed to rescue the concept of meaning from both supernaturalism and pure, atomistic subjectivity.

To push this further, I wonder if we should explore the _source_ of these narrative values. May frames them as emerging from a "web of reasons," but are they truly universal, or are they culturally specific? Could a value celebrated in one era become meaningless in another?
