## Beauvoir and The Second Sex: A Correction to the Record

Based on the work of Margaret A. Simons

Let’s get one thing straight right out of the gate: History has a nasty habit of reducing brilliant women to the footnotes of the men they slept with. Margaret A. Simons’ _Beauvoir and The Second Sex_ is basically a giant, well-researched "actually, no" to that tendency. It digs into the messy, brilliant reality of Simone de Beauvoir—not just as Jean-Paul Sartre’s partner, but as a heavyweight thinker who essentially built the launchpad for radical feminism while everyone else was still figuring out how to lace their boots.

The "I’m Not a Philosopher" Defense

Here is the paradox that drives philosophical types crazy: Beauvoir constantly insisted she wasn’t a philosopher. She saw herself as a literary writer. But before you take her word for it, you have to understand her definitions. To her, a "philosopher" was someone who built massive, rigid systems—think Descartes or Hegel constructing their mental fortresses. She wasn’t interested in that. She wanted to explore the messy, lived experience of existence through novels and essays.

But here’s the kicker: just because she didn't want the label doesn't mean she didn't do the work. American philosophers look at _The Second Sex_ and see deep metaphysics. She was doing philosophy; she just didn’t want the stuffy title that came with it.

The Sartre Situation

The standard narrative goes like this: Sartre was the genius, and Beauvoir applied his ideas. Simons’ work flips this table over. Their relationship was fifty years of intense, reciprocal editing. They tore each other’s drafts apart. Beauvoir admits Being and Nothingness influenced her, sure, but she also clarifies that the whole concept of "The Other" in relation to women? That was hers. Sartre wasn't even particularly interested in the "woman question" until she brought it up.

There’s this fantastic detail where Beauvoir notes that she might have actually sparked Sartre’s later interest in childhood development. She didn’t just reflect his light; she was often the one holding the torch.

One Is Not Born, One Becomes

If you take nothing else away from this, take the line that shook the foundation of gender theory: "One is not born a woman, but rather becomes one."

This is the core of her social constructionism. Beauvoir was allergic to the idea of a fixed "feminine nature" or biological determinism. She saw that as a trap designed to keep women in a box. You aren't born with a set of "womanly" personality traits; society layers them onto you like heavy coats until you can barely move.

She applied this same razor-sharp logic to motherhood. She wasn't against being a mother, but she was deeply critical of the _institution_ of motherhood in the West. She saw it as a system that often enslaved women to the home, stripping them of their ability to be "transcendent"—to have goals and projects outside of the domestic sphere. It’s not that motherhood is bad; it’s that the social deal women get for doing it is terrible.

The Lost in Translation Problem

Clarence is grinding his teeth just thinking about this part. It turns out, the English-speaking world got a raw deal with the original translation of The Second Sex. Huge chunks of history and philosophy were cut or mistranslated. We’re talking about a mutilated text that made her sound less like a rigorous thinker and more like a casual commentator. This contributed to years of people dismissing her work as "not real philosophy."

The Heart of the Matter

Simons also cracks open Beauvoir’s early diaries from 1927, proving she was wrestling with heavy existential themes—despair, the void, the self—long before she met Sartre. We also get a glimpse into her personal life that defies the sanitized history books: her intense, often sexual relationships with women, and her lifelong struggle to balance her desire for autonomy with a deep, aching need for connection.

She rejected the master/slave dynamic in love. She wanted reciprocity. She wanted a world where men and women looked at each other and saw another _subject_, another human being with their own internal universe, rather than an object to be possessed.

Beauvoir wasn’t just chronicling oppression; she was handing us the keys to dismantle it.

### Commentary from Clarence & Eloise

**Eloise:** Oh, my heart! Can we just take a moment for the "aching need for connection"? That is so deeply, painfully human. I love that we emphasized that she wasn't just this cold, intellectual brain in a jar—she was a person who loved fiercely and struggled with loneliness. And the fact that she was pioneering these ideas about "becoming" a woman... it’s like she gave us permission to define ourselves. She is such a wildfire! It makes me want to go out and hug every woman who has ever felt like she had to fit into a mold she didn't make.

**Clarence:** I’m still stuck on the translation issues. It is genuinely horrifying. Imagine spending years crafting a nuanced argument about the ontological status of women, only to have some translator decide, "Eh, this paragraph about history seems boring, let's cut it." It’s intellectual malpractice! But I’m glad we clarified the "I'm not a philosopher" bit. It’s a classic case of humility—or perhaps a specific definition of terms—obscuring the reality of the output. She was doing phenomenology whether she admitted it or not. Getting that right matters because if we don't, we lose the genealogy of the ideas. We can't just attribute everything to Sartre because he shouted the loudest.

**Eloise:** Exactly! Reciprocity! It’s the magic word.

**Clarence:** It’s the _logical_ word. Without it, you just have solipsism and power struggles. Which, frankly, we have enough of.

**The Great Philosophical Vandalism of Howard M. Parshley**

The English-speaking world didn't actually read Simone de Beauvoir for about sixty years. We read a version of her thoughts filtered through the mind of Howard M. Parshley, a zoology professor who, frankly, had no business being there. Parshley operated under the baffling assumption that a book about women couldn't possibly be a book about philosophy. So, he treated _The Second Sex_ less like a masterpiece of existentialist thought and more like a biology textbook that needed a severe edit.

This wasn't just a bad translation; it was a demolition job.

Turning Freedom into Biology

The most catastrophic error was a complete inversion of Beauvoir’s core thesis. Beauvoir used the term la réalité humaine (human reality)—a heavy-hitter phrase borrowed from Heidegger and Sartre to denote that humans are defined by what we do, not what we are. We create ourselves.

Parshley translated this as "the real nature of man."

Do you see the disaster? Beauvoir was shouting, "Biology is not destiny! We are free to create our essence!" and Parshley translated it as, "Here is our fixed biological nature." He took a manifesto of radical freedom and turned it into essentialist determinism.

He didn't stop there. He mixed up the technical terms for consciousness (_pour-soi_ or "for-itself") with the term for inanimate objects (_en-soi_ or "in-itself"). In existential terms, this is the difference between a person and a rock. By flipping them, he ruined Beauvoir’s analysis of oppression, making it sound like women were naturally passive objects rather than conscious subjects being forced into a passive role.

The Erasure of the "Boring" Bits

Parshley apparently found women’s history tedious, so he just... deleted it. He cut roughly 10% of the entire book.

- **The Roll Call:** He erased the names of seventy-eight historical women—politicians, saints, artists—effectively un-personing them from the English text.
    
- **The Struggle:** He scrubbed out references to the _querelle des femmes_ (the historic debate on the status of women) and the angry writings of women like the Duchess of Newcastle.
    
- **The Daily Grind:** He threw out entire pages describing the repetitive, crushing labor of the housewife, as well as the diaries of Sophie Tolstoy, which vividly depicted the "annihilation" of self in marriage.
    

Silencing the Race Analogy

Perhaps most damaging for the American context, Parshley muted Beauvoir’s intersectional framework. Beauvoir had explicitly connected the oppression of women to racism, drawing on Gunnar Myrdal and her mentor Richard Wright. She viewed race and gender as similar social constructs—caste systems designed to otherize. Parshley cut these comparisons. By doing so, he severed the intellectual link between the civil rights movement and the feminist movement, leaving English readers with a "whitewashed" version of her theory.

Basically, Parshley looked at a complex, rigorous philosophical architecture and decided to turn it into a ranch-style home because he didn't understand what the flying buttresses were for.

### Commentary from Clarence & Eloise

**Clarence:** I am physically unwell. "The real nature of man"? That is not a translation error; that is a crime against ontology! It’s like translating "The sky is blue" as "The ocean is dry." It fundamentally alters the truth conditions of the statement. If you change _existence_ (the act of being) to _nature_ (a fixed state), you have essentially written a different book. And the "in-itself" versus "for-itself" swap? That’s the difference between having a soul and being a paperweight. It makes me nervous just thinking about how many undergraduates wrote papers based on faulty premises because a zoologist didn't check a philosophical dictionary.

**Eloise:** It’s the silence that gets me. Seventy-eight women! Just... poof. Gone. He decided their names didn't matter, that their stories were "boring." That is violence. And cutting the Seneca Falls reference? That’s our history! That’s the community of women fighting for a voice, and he just put his hand over their mouths. But you know what? It makes me appreciate Beauvoir even more. Her voice was so strong that it eventually broke through even _this_ disaster of a translation. She couldn't be kept down, even by a man with an eraser.

**Clarence:** It is a testament to the robustness of her ideas that they survived at all. But yes, the intersectional erasure is also critical. If American feminism had understood the race analogy in 1953, the movements might have aligned much sooner.

**Eloise:** Exactly! He kept us apart by hiding the connection. It’s tragic.

Next Logical Question:

Considering how badly the Parshley translation mangled the text, how was the 2009 Constance Borde and Sheila Malovany-Chevalier translation received by the academic community, and did it fully resolve these specific philosophical and historical grievances?
