We tend to treat the culture wars like a series of unrelated explosions—a skirmish over pronouns here, a battle over bathroom access there. But Carl Trueman, in _The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self_, suggests we are missing the forest for the burning trees. He argues that these conflicts aren't sudden glitches in the matrix; they are the inevitable result of a centuries-long revolution in how we answer the question: "Who am I?"

Trueman’s thesis is blunt: You cannot isolate the sexual revolution from the total overhaul of human identity. Sex is simply the headline act for a deeper shift. We have moved from a world where identity was something you discovered outside yourself (in God, nation, or family) to a world where identity is something you excavate from within.

To explain this seismic shift, Trueman relies on a triad of thinkers who saw the cracks forming long before the rest of us:

**Charles Taylor** calls this "expressive individualism". The logic goes like this: My true self is hidden inside me, buried under layers of social expectation. To be a "real" person, I must act out those inner feelings publicly. But here is the kicker: it’s not enough for me to just express it. For me to feel whole, _you_ must applaud it. If the self is social, then society’s refusal to validate my inner reality feels like an act of violence. This is why identity politics has become a zero-sum game of recognition6.

**Philip Rieff** provides the diagnostic for our new environment: the "therapeutic" society. Historically, culture was a set of instructions on how to behave—how to repress your immediate urges for the sake of the group. Today, that script has flipped. The highest good is no longer holiness or duty; it is psychological well-being8. We are no longer "political man" or "religious man"; we are "psychological man," drifting through a world where "feeling good" is the only remaining absolute.

**Alasdair MacIntyre** explains why our arguments are so loud and so useless. He calls it "emotivism". because we have discarded any shared moral framework, our ethical debates are really just two people shouting their emotional preferences at one another. There is no referee, no rulebook, just a clash of wills.

How did we get here? Trueman traces the genealogy through the usual suspects. **Rousseau** taught us that society is the corrupter and the inner savage is noble. **Nietzsche** blew up the bridge behind us, removing the metaphysical safety net and telling us we must create our own values. **Marx** politicized everything, and **Freud** sexualized everything.

The result is a shift from a "mimetic" world—where we try to imitate a fixed, external order—to a "poietic" world, where we are forced to act as the poets and creators of our own reality. We are now burdened with the exhausting task of inventing ourselves, every single day.

**Eloise:** It really is exhausting, isn't it? The "poietic" thing? It sounds romantic—"I am the poet of my own life!"—but in practice, it’s just so much _pressure_. If I have to invent my own meaning, my own morality, and my own identity, and then I have to market it to everyone else so they validate it... I mean, who has the energy? I think that’s why people are so angry. It’s not just about politics; it’s the fatigue of having to be the God of your own tiny universe. Sometimes you just want someone else to tell you what the rules are so you can relax.

**Clarence:** That’s the tragedy of "emotivism." Without an external standard—something outside of our own heads—we lose the ability to actually _reason_ together. If you say "X is good" and I say "X is bad," and all we really mean is "I like X" and "I hate X," then the conversation is over before it starts. It’s just power dynamics masked as morality. Trueman’s point about Nietzsche calling the bluff is crucial. If we’re going to kill the old gods, we have to be honest about the fact that we’re replacing them with our own reflections. And frankly, I don't trust my reflection that much. It looks tired.

Next logical question:

"If 'expressive individualism' makes shared community impossible, how can we rebuild social cohesion without returning to the repressive structures of the past?"
