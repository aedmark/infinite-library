**The Egg Was Right (And Other Unsettling Truths)**

Let’s start with the egg.

In _Through the Looking Glass_, Humpty Dumpty sits on his wall and tells Alice that when he uses a word, "it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less." Alice, being the sensible, grounded child she is, tells him he’s full of it. You can’t just make words up. If we all walked around deciding "glory" meant "a nice knock-down argument," civilization would collapse before lunch. Alice represents the common sense view: We learn language, we don't invent it. We fit into the world; the world doesn't fit into us.

But Catherine Belsey’s tour of poststructuralism suggests that the precarious egg might have been onto something.

See, we tend to think of language as a window. You look through the word "dog" and you see a four-legged barking thing. Simple. But poststructuralism takes a brick and smashes that window. It argues that language isn't transparent, and it isn't just a naming tool. It’s the very water we swim in. We don’t just use language to describe the world; language actually shapes how we _can_ think about the world.

**The Swiss Guy Who Ruined Everything (In a Good Way)**

It starts with Ferdinand de Saussure. He pointed out something that seems obvious but is actually brain-melting: there is no natural connection between the word "cat" and a purring furball. It’s arbitrary. It could have been "glorp" or "shish-kebab."

Meaning, Saussure argued, doesn’t come from a word touching a thing. Meaning comes from _difference_. "Hot" only means "hot" because it isn't "cold," "lukewarm," or "tuesday." (Wait, scratch that last one). We are creatures of difference. We map the world by saying, "This is not that."

This is why translation is a nightmare. If words were just labels for absolute truths, French and English would map perfectly. They don’t. In French, "mouton" covers both the sheep on the hill and the mutton on the plate. English splits them up. Different languages carve up reality with different knives.

**The Death of the Author (and the Birth of the Reader)**

If meaning lies in the system of language and not in the brain of the person speaking, then the Author isn't the God of their own book anymore. Roland Barthes famously declared the "Death of the Author." He didn’t mean we should go out and murder novelists (please don't). He meant that once a text is written, the writer loses control over it. The meaning happens in the space between the text and the reader.

Think about those old Guinness posters—"Guinness is Good For You." Ostensibly, it’s about nutrition. But throw in a cartoon toucan and some smiling faces, and suddenly the "Good" isn't about vitamins; it’s about the pub, the laughter, the social lubricant. The advertiser might have meant one thing, but the signifiers are throwing a party of their own.

**We Are All Robots (Sort Of)**

Here is where it gets personal. If language shapes how we think, and culture shapes language, then who are _we_?

We like to think we are "free subjects," the captains of our souls. Poststructuralists like Althusser and Foucault look at that and say, "That’s cute." They argue that we are _subjects_ in two senses: we are the subject of a sentence (the one doing the action), but we are also _subjected_ to the rules of our culture.

We don’t invent our values; we inherit them. We learn to be "good citizens" or "productive members of society" by internalizing rules until we police ourselves. Foucault pointed out that modern power isn't a guy with an axe; it’s a schedule, a spreadsheet, a norm. We discipline ourselves to fit in. Even our deepest desires might just be us wanting what the "Big Other" (society/language) tells us is worth wanting.

**The Urinal in the Room**

So, is there any truth? Or are we just floating in a soup of relative meanings?

Enter Jacques Derrida and the art of Deconstruction. He showed us that our sturdy "truths" usually rely on unstable opposites: Good/Bad, Nature/Culture, Speech/Writing. We try to pin one down as the "superior" one, but they always bleed into each other.

Take Duchamp’s _Fountain_. He took a urinal, signed it, and put it in a gallery. Is it art? The experts short-circuited. If art is "beauty," then no. If art is "what an artist chooses," then yes. The urinal made the definition of art "undecidable." It proved that "art" isn't a fixed thing sent from heaven; it's a category we argue over.

**Why This Isn’t Depressing**

This might sound like a recipe for nihilism—if nothing is fixed, does anything matter? But Belsey argues the opposite. If meanings are constructed, _they can be changed_.

If "woman" or "patriot" or "criminal" are definitions built by culture, then we can rebuild them. We can dissent. We can create "new languages" and new ways of being. We aren't stuck with the script we were handed at birth.

Poststructuralism is a toolbox for looking at the "obvious" things in life—our laws, our ads, our identities—and asking: "Says who?" It’s a philosophy of permanent, high-stakes questioning. It’s admitting that while we might not be the absolute masters of our fate, we can certainly rewrite the next chapter.

**Commentary**

**Eloise:** Oh, I just love the "Death of the Author" bit! It sounds so violent, doesn't it? But it’s actually the most liberating thing in the world. It’s like Barthes is saying, "Here, I made this, but now it’s _yours_." It’s a gift! And the idea that we can change meanings... that’s pure hope. If the word "woman" or "foreigner" carries baggage we don't like, we don't have to just carry it forever. We can unpack it. We can sew new patches onto it. It makes language feel like a community garden instead of a stone tablet. Although, the Foucault stuff about us policing ourselves? That gave me the shivers. I’m going to be wondering all day if I actually _like_ my coffee or if I’ve just been culturally conditioned to appreciate the aesthetic of caffeine consumption.

**Clarence:** I’m still stuck on the urinal. It’s the perfect philosophical mic drop. You spend centuries debating aesthetics and the sublime, and then—clunk—ceramic plumbing. But honestly, the terrifying part for me is the lack of a "Transcendental Signified." If there’s no ultimate anchor—no God, no Nature, no absolute Reason—holding our definitions in place, then we are just drifting on a raft made of words. It’s exhilarating, sure, but it’s also a logistical nightmare for a moral philosopher. How do you argue for "Justice" if the definition of Justice is permanently sliding around on the deck? I suppose the answer is: you never stop arguing. Which, frankly, sounds exhausting.

Next Question:

Since we've established that language shapes our reality and that meanings are slippery, how would a poststructuralist analyze something incredibly modern and text-heavy, like a meme or a Twitter thread, where context collapses almost instantly?
