## The Audit of the Heart

When Søren Kierkegaard released _Works of Love_ in the autumn of 1847, he was performing a strategic pivot. Just months prior, he had addressed "that single individual," a focus that risked painting him as a recluse with no concept of social connection. To counter this, he didn't issue a retraction; he issued a challenge. He moved from the interior self to the ultimate social bind: Love.

This wasn't a whim. It was the architectural capstone of years spent dissecting the human condition in _Either/Or_ and _Stages on Life's Way_. But here, Kierkegaard wields a linguistic scalpel unavailable to English speakers. He slices the concept in two: there is **_Elskov_** (erotic love, preference, desire) and **_Kjerlighed_** (spiritual, charitable love). In English, we fumble with the single word "love" for both tacos and spouses; Kierkegaard demands we stop confusing the two.

These are "deliberations," not sermons. Sermons assume we all agree on the definitions. Deliberations assume we are lost. He intends to shake us out of our comfortable linguistic drift and force a confrontation with the "dialectic of truth."

### Labor, Not Luck

Kierkegaard strips the romance away: love is labor. It is a deed, not a mood. A mood is like the weather; you cannot build a house on it. Love, he argues, has a biological imperative to be known by its "fruits," much like a plant that cannot help but photosynthesize. To hide love is to kill it.

However, the audit is tricky. There is no empirical checklist—no specific gesture that guarantees love’s presence. A kiss can be a betrayal; a harsh word can be a rescue. Because the evidence is slippery, Kierkegaard lands on a startling necessity: we must **believe** in love to see it. It is a spiritual recognition, a case of "like knowing like." To view the world cynically is to blind oneself to the mechanism of love entirely.

### The Anchor of "Shall"

Here lies the radical core of the text: Christian love is a **duty**. It is anchored by the commandment: "You shall love."

To the romantic, this sounds like a prison sentence. The Poet—Kierkegaard’s archetype for spontaneous, emotional passion—believes love is higher than law. The Poet wants to swear oaths in the heat of the moment. But Kierkegaard argues that the "Shall" is the only thing that secures freedom.

Spontaneous love is a hostage situation; it depends entirely on reciprocity. If you stop loving me, my spontaneous love for you withers. I am a slave to your affection. But the love rooted in duty says, "I shall love you regardless of how you act." That is independence. That is security against despair. When the "change of eternity" enters the equation, love becomes immune to the volatility of human emotion.

### The Mathematics of Self-Denial

Kierkegaard stages a cage match between the Poet and the Christian.

- **The Poet** worships preference. This love is exclusive; it seeks the "one and only." Kierkegaard diagnoses this as merely "augmented self-love." You love the other person because they reflect you, or because they make you feel good. It is a transaction.
    
- The Christian is commanded to love the Neighbor. The Neighbor is not the guy next door with the loud lawnmower; the Neighbor is the category of "all people."
    
    This requires self-denial. It is the mathematical cancellation of "mine and yours." The person who loves in this way does not seek equity. They are willing to be deceived, to give without return, and to look like a fool in the eyes of the world. In helping others, this lover becomes invisible, helping the other "stand by himself" so that the helper "infinitely vanishes." It is the ultimate ghost act.
    

### The Construction Site

How does this operate in reality? Kierkegaard insists that "Love builds up." But it builds in reverse. You do not force love into someone; you **presuppose** it is already there. You treat the other person as if they are already the person they should be, and in doing so, you "love forth love."

This is an active, aggressive hope. It "believes all things"—not out of stupidity, but out of strategy. It "hides a multitude of sins" not by ignoring them, but by overlaying them with forgiveness. Even in the face of death, this love persists. "Recollecting one who is dead" is the purest test, because the dead cannot pay you back. If you can love a corpse faithfully, you have finally learned to love unselfishly.

### The Cold Shoulder

The book was a commercial dud. It received "scant attention," and the few reviews it got were superficial—one reviewer spent more words apologizing for the length of his review than analyzing the book. Kierkegaard noted the irony with his usual acerbic wit.

But his true target, the Primate of the Danish Church, Bishop Mynster, offered only a cold shoulder. Mynster recognized the threat. _Works of Love_ is a "polemical" text disguised as a devotional. It attacks the comfortable, bourgeois Christianity that demands nothing. It insists that love is not a feeling to be enjoyed, but a "moral task" to be endured and enacted. It turns the world "topsy-turvy," demanding we trade our preferences for principles.

### The Editors' Desk

**Clarence:** I have to admit, the logic of the "duty" argument is terrifyingly sound. We usually think of "duty" as the opposite of "romance," right? Like, doing the dishes is a duty; kissing your partner is romance. But Kierkegaard is essentially saying that relying on the "kissing" part is structural suicide. If you build a relationship solely on the feeling of wanting to kiss someone, the moment you have the flu or they say something stupid, the foundation cracks. "Duty" is the rebar in the concrete. It’s unsexy, but it’s the only thing that stops the building from falling down during an earthquake.

**Eloise:** Oh, stop being so grim! It _is_ sexy, in a way. Think about the "presupposing love" part. That’s just... it’s the most generous way you can possibly live. It’s looking at someone who is being difficult or angry and deciding, "I’m going to treat you like you’re already the best version of yourself until you catch up." It’s basically holding space for someone’s potential before they’ve even earned it. That’s what good community work is! It’s not "I’ll help you once you prove you’re worthy." It’s "I’ll help you, and that will make you worthy."

**Clarence:** That’s... actually a very "Elskov" way of looking at "Kjerlighed," Eloise. You’re romanticizing the heavy lifting. But I’ll give you this: the idea of the "Neighbor" being a category rather than a specific person is the ultimate check on our ego. It’s easy to love the people who like us. Kierkegaard is asking us to love the people we have zero "preference" for. That’s not natural. That’s a rupture in our biological programming.

**Eloise:** And that’s why it’s a "Work"! It’s not supposed to be natural; it’s supposed to be supernatural. Or at least, super-intentional. Also, can we talk about the shade he threw at the reviewer? Complaining about the length of a book review while ignoring a police report? Kierkegaard was the original king of "This meeting could have been an email."

**Clarence:** He was the original king of "I am the smartest person in the room and I am miserable about it." But he was right. We obsess over the superficial and ignore the structural. Which, ironically, is exactly what Bonepoke tries to prevent us from doing.

**Eloise:** Speaking of structure...

**Next Step:** Kierkegaard mentions that this book was a pivot from his "aesthetic" writings (like _Either/Or_) to his "religious" writings. Would you like to explore the concept of the "Three Stages of Existence" (Aesthetic, Ethical, Religious) to see exactly where _Works of Love_ fits on that map?
