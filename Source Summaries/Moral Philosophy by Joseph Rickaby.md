**The Architecture of "Should": A Deep Dive into Rickaby’s Moral Philosophy**

Joseph Rickaby’s take on Moral Philosophy isn't just a list of rules; it’s the science of "human acts."1 He draws a sharp line in the sand between things that just happen to us (like growing hair or digesting lunch) and things we _do_—acts where we are in the driver’s seat.

If you aren't the master of the act, it’s not a moral question. But if you are? Then we have to talk about three things: Ethics (happiness), Deontology (duty), and Natural Law (the blueprint).2

**1. The Happiness Glitch**

Rickaby starts with a fascinating, almost tragic observation. We all have a rational soul that craves _perfect_ happiness. It’s hardwired into the system. But here’s the kicker: Earth literally cannot provide it.

We can get "contentment," sure. We can have a nice dinner or solve a puzzle. But our capacity for happiness exceeds the planet’s inventory. Rickaby suggests that because nature doesn’t build bridges to nowhere, this unquenchable thirst proves there is a "Last End" beyond this life. We are square pegs in a round world, designed for a "life too good for man."

**2. Anatomy of a Moral Act**

So, how do we judge if an act is "good"? You can't just look at the result. Rickaby breaks it down into a three-part diagnostic:

1. **The End:** What you _want_ to happen. The target.
    
2. **The Means:** How you get there.
    
3. **The Circumstances:** The who, what, where, and when.
    

Here is the golden rule: **The End does not justify the Means.** If you want to build a hospital (Good End) but you fund it by robbing a bank (Bad Means), the whole action is poisoned. Rickaby insists that for an action to be good, it has to be good _all the way through_. A single defect in the means or circumstances rots the whole apple.

**3. Ignorance: The "I Didn't Know" Defense**

Can you get away with "I didn't know it was wrong"? Rickaby says: It depends.

- **Invincible Ignorance:** You genuinely didn't know, and couldn't have known. You are off the hook.
    
- **Affected Ignorance:** You purposefully avoided learning the rules so you could plead ignorance later. This doesn't work; you are fully guilty.
    
- **Crass Ignorance:** This is the lazy one. You didn't _try_ to be ignorant, but you didn't try to learn, either. Think of a surgeon who skips medical conferences and then bungles a surgery. The error was an accident, but his ignorance was a choice. He is responsible for the risk he took lightheartedly.
    

**4. The Cabinet of Virtues**

Rickaby organizes our moral habits into the "Cardinal Virtues," and honestly, it reads like a government flowchart.3

- **Prudence ( The Premier):** The intellect’s ability to judge the right move in the moment.4 Without this, courage is just recklessness.
    
- **Justice (Foreign Affairs):** The will to give others what is due to them. This is the only virtue that strictly deals with _other people_.
    
- **Temperance (Home Department - Interior):** Regulating the desire for pleasure (food, drink, sex).5
    
- **Fortitude (Home Department - Defense):** Regulating the fear of pain or danger.
    

**5. The Kant Beef: Who Commands the Commander?**

Rickaby picks a fight with Immanuel Kant. Kant famously argued for the "autonomy of reason"—that we create moral laws for ourselves.6 Rickaby thinks this is nonsense.

A law requires a superior to command a subordinate. You cannot "command" yourself any more than you can arm-wrestle yourself. If I forbid myself from eating a cookie, and then I eat the cookie, who is going to punish me? Me?

Rickaby argues that for "Duty" and "Sin" to be real concepts, there must be a "Living Reason" distinct from us—God.7 If you remove God, "sin" becomes merely "philosophical indecency" or "acting like a fool." It loses its binding force.

**6. Probabilism: The Benefit of the Doubt**

This is a surprisingly lenient concept. What if you genuinely don't know if a law applies to you? Rickaby introduces **Probabilism**: _A doubtful law has no binding power._

If you have done your homework, asked the experts, and there is still genuine debate about whether an action is allowed, you aren't bound to take the "safest" path. You are free to act. Objectively, the law either exists or it doesn't, but subjectively, if the signal is fuzzy, you aren't on the hook.

**7. Quick-Fire Applications**

- **Lying:** Rickaby is hardcore here. A lie is "speaking against your mind." Even if you don't deceive anyone, if your words don't match your thoughts, it's intrinsically evil. It breaks the instrument of speech.
    
- **The State:** The State isn't just a club we joined (Social Contract); it’s a necessary organism for human development. Its power is limited to "this-world" concerns—peace and justice—not saving souls.
    
- **War:** War is just self-defense writ large. If a State can't protect its citizens, it fails its primary job.

### Commentary from the Desk

**Eloise:** "I can’t stop thinking about the 'Happiness Glitch.' The idea that we are built with a hunger that the world doesn't have enough food to satisfy... it’s heartbreaking, but also hopeful? It explains why we’re all so restless. We’re trying to fill a 'perfect happiness' shaped hole with 'imperfect' things like promotions or new shoes. Also, 'Crass Ignorance' is going into my daily vocabulary. It’s the perfect description for so much of what we see on the news."

**Clarence:** "I appreciate Rickaby’s ferocity on the definition of a lie. We usually define lying by the _intent to deceive_, but he defines it as a _misuse of the faculty of speech_. Even if I talk to a wall, if I say 'I am a fish,' I have committed a moral error because I used my mouth-tools for something they weren't designed for. It’s rigid, yes, but intellectually consistent. And his dismissal of Kant is classic theological maneuvering: 'You can't be your own boss because you'll always let yourself off the hook.' Hard to argue with that."

Suggested Follow-Up:

"Rickaby argues that 'Probabilism' lets us off the hook if a law is doubtful—does this apply to modern gray areas, like AI ethics or copyright law, where the rules literally haven't been written yet?"
