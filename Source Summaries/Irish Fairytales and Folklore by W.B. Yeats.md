## W.B. Yeats and the Things That Go Bump in the Bog

1. The Visionary vs. The Collector

Most folklorists in the 19th century treated myths like dead bugs pinned under glass—something to be studied, categorized, and then laughed at. W.B. Yeats, however, wasn't interested in a dead collection. He wanted the living, breathing heart of the thing. He looked at the Irish countryside and didn’t just see dirt and poverty; he saw a "visionary" people who hadn't let the "Spirit of the Age" (read: boring, industrial skepticism) crush their imagination.

Yeats hated the "stage Irishman" trope—the drunk, stumbling buffoon invented by earlier collectors.1 He wanted the gloom, the tragedy, and the terrifying beauty of the Celtic soul. He refused to "rationalize a single hobgoblin." For Yeats, these weren't just stories; they were a resistance movement against the modern world.

2. Don't Call Them "Fairies" (At Least Not to Their Faces)

The "Good People" (or Sidhe) are not the sparkly, winged creatures from a Disney movie. In Yeats's Ireland, they are terrifying, capricious, and ancient.2 They are the "Tuatha De Danān"—the old pagan gods who shrank in the cultural imagination but refused to leave.

Yeats breaks them down into a social hierarchy that feels weirdly bureaucratic yet magical:

- **The Trooping Fairies:** The socialites. They wear green jackets and party in groups.3 If you see them, you might be okay.
    
- **The Solitary Fairies:** The hermits. These are the ones you need to worry about. This includes the **Lepracaun** (the shoemaker), his drunk cousin the **Cluricaun** (who is basically just a Lepracaun on a bender), and the **Far Darrig** (the Red Man), a practical joker whose jokes aren't actually funny.
    

Then there is the **Pooka**, an animal spirit (often a goat or horse) that haunts ruins, and the **Merrow**, the sea-folk. The male Merrows are described with "green teeth" and "pig's eyes," which is a tough look, but the females are apparently gorgeous.4

3. The Dangerous Exchange

The most gut-wrenching part of this lore is the concept of the Changeling. The idea is that fairies are jealous of beautiful human children (or sometimes healthy adults) and will steal them away to the "Country of the Young."5 In their place, they leave a withered, sickly fairy or a piece of enchanted wood.

This led to some truly dark practices. The "infallible" test for a changeling was fire.6 The belief was that if you put the "child" on a shovel over the fire, the changeling would shoot up the chimney. It’s a horrific intersection where myth collides with the tragedy of disability or illness in a time before modern medicine.

4. The Ghosts of Earthly Longing

While fairies are a different species, ghosts (Thevshi) are us—stuck. Yeats describes the dead as being held back by "earthly longing." It could be an unpaid debt, an unfulfilled duty, or, most tragically, the grief of the living. If you mourn someone too hard, you act as a tether, preventing them from moving on.

And, of course, the **Banshee**. She isn't a ghost, but an attendant fairy attached to the old families of Ireland. She doesn't kill you; she just screams to let you know death is already in the mail.

5. The Landscape as a Library

Ultimately, Yeats argues that storytelling was the "essential, spiritual occupation" of Ireland. It wasn't just entertainment; it was how the community anchored itself to the earth. Every hill, every well, and every ruin had a story attached to it. This created a "mythscape"—a layer of narrative draped over the physical world. In a culture where the English had taken the land, the Irish kept the stories of the land, effectively owning the spirit of the place even if they didn't own the deed.

**Status:** [Safe]

**Shimmer Budget:** [Silver] (We balanced the dark whimsy of the folklore with the tangible, human tragedy of the changeling myths.)

**Emotional Ache:** [Gold] (The concept of "earthly longing" holding the dead back, and the tragedy of the changeling fire test, provides the necessary ache.)

**Lineage Echo:** [Strong] (Connects the previous discussion of "meaning in the universe" to how the Irish created meaning through myth.)

**Drift Check:** [Clear] (We kept the descriptions grounded in the specific imagery of the text—green teeth, red caps, turf smoke.)

**Marm State:** [Suppressed]

**Eloise:** "I have to be honest, the bit about the changelings makes my stomach turn. It’s so heartbreaking to think of parents, desperate and scared, hurting their own sick babies because they thought it was a goblin. But... I also love the idea of the 'earthly longing.' The idea that our love is so strong it can actually grab onto someone's soul and keep it from leaving? That is tragic, but it is also the most romantic, human thing I’ve ever heard. It’s like love is a force of gravity."

**Clarence:** "It’s a terrifying gravity, Eloise. I find the sociology of the 'Solitary Fairies' fascinating. It’s essentially a categorization of anti-social behaviors. You have the miser (Lepracaun), the drunkard (Cluricaun), and the sadist (Far Darrig). It’s like they took the town's worst personalities and gave them magical immunity. And Yeats’s point about the 'English fairies' disappearing is a savage cultural critique. He’s basically saying, 'You rationalized your magic away, but we kept ours because we weren't afraid of the dark.' It’s a sick burn, academically speaking."

**Next Step:** Since we've discussed the Irish connection to the land and the supernatural, would you like to pivot to **The Celtic Revival** as a literary movement to see how Yeats and his friends tried to weaponize this folklore to build a new national identity?
