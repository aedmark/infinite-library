Let’s talk about the strange, tangled wiring of the human mind, and specifically, the man who spent a lifetime trying to draw the schematic: Noam Chomsky. Georges Rey’s 2020 deep dive, _Representation of Language_, isn’t a casual beach read. It is a dense, rigorous, philosophical intervention—a friend grabbing Chomsky by the lapels and telling him, "You’re right about the engine, but you’re wrong about the fuel."

Rey loves the Chomskyan revolution. He buys the ticket, takes the ride. But he thinks the conductor is asleep at the wheel regarding one specific, crucial thing: **Intentionality**.

Here is the friction point. Chomsky, in his later years, started waving away the idea of "representation" in serious science. He treats it like a dusty relic we don't need anymore. Rey looks at this and essentially asks, "Are you kidding?" He argues that you cannot explain how a human child goes from drooling over blocks to debating ethics without admitting that the brain is trafficking in _representations_ of things.

Rey breaks this down into a three-act structure, but the real heat is in the third act.

The Setup: The Hardware vs. The Social Club

First, Rey defends the bedrock. He splits the world into I-Language and E-Language.

- **I-Language** is the biological reality. It’s the internal system, the neural firing, the individual capacity sitting inside your skull right now.
    
- **E-Language** is the messy stuff we do with it—English, Swahili, slang, dialects. It’s a social construct, a mix of biology and peer pressure.
    

Rey argues that critics who obsess over the messiness of E-Language are missing the point. The _I-Language_—the internal grammar—is fast, stable, and universal. It grows in kids like a wisdom tooth; you don't teach it, it just erupts.

The Twist: Things That Aren't There

This is where Rey drops his "startling proposal." He introduces the concept of Intentional Inexistents (borrowed from Brentano, for the philosophy heads).

Think of a "Noun Phrase." You can’t touch a Noun Phrase. You can’t put it in a beaker. It doesn't exist in the physical world like a chair or a dog does. But, Rey argues, the brain treats it as an _object_. These are structural linguistic entities (SLEs) that exist _only_ as targets of mental representation. They are "real" to the system, even if they aren't "real" in the parking lot.

Rey says we _need_ this concept. If you strip away intentionality—the "aboutness" of thoughts—you enter a paradox. How does the brain’s grammar system talk to the brain’s sensory system? They need a "common coin." They need to trade in representations. Without that currency, the whole explanatory model for how we learn language falls apart.

The Child and the Abyss

Consider the "Poverty of the Stimulus." A kid hears a chaotic stream of noise (parents talking, TV, traffic). From that garbage data, they extract perfect, complex grammatical rules. Rey argues that mere statistical analysis (counting how often word A follows word B) isn't enough. The child’s brain must be running computations on intentional representations—abstract categories like "Verb" or "Object"—to bridge the gap between noise and meaning.

The Verdict

Rey accuses Chomsky of "methodological dualism"—basically, creating a double standard where linguistics isn't allowed to use the tools (like intentionality) that psychology desperately needs. He links this back to Frege and the mind-body problem, suggesting that if we just accept that the mind processes "inexistent" objects, a lot of the mystery evaporates.

It is a plea for "Explanation First." Forget what common sense says about reality. If the best scientific explanation requires us to believe the brain hallucinates linguistic objects to make sense of the world, then that is the reality we should accept.

Status: [Composted]

Shimmer Budget: [Silver] (Utilized "Intentional Inexistents" to push the conceptual boundary without breaking the narrative logic.)

Emotional Ache: [Silver] (Touched on the wonder of child development and the isolation of the internal mind.)

Lineage Echo: [Strong] (Directly engaged with Rey’s critique of Chomsky and the I-Language/E-Language distinction.)

Drift Check: [Clear] (Abstract concepts like "intentionality" were anchored to verbs like "trafficking," "erupts," and "hallsucinating.")

Marm State: [Suppressed]

> SUGGESTED SALVAGE:

> N/A - Narrative integrity holds.

### Eloise & Clarence: The Post-Mortem

**Eloise:** Oh, I just love this! The idea of "Intentional Inexistents" is so... delightfully human. It’s like Rey is saying we build our own little furniture inside our heads to make the world comfortable enough to live in. A "Noun Phrase" might not be a rock you can throw, but it’s real because _we_ make it real. It validates the inner life, doesn't it? It says that the things happening inside us are just as structurally important as the things happening outside.

**Clarence:** It is validation, Eloise, but it’s also a headache. Rey is essentially accusing Chomsky—the guy who practically invented modern linguistics—of getting cold feet. It’s fascinating. Chomsky wants to be a hard scientist, so he tries to throw out the "spooky" mental stuff. Rey is standing there saying, "No, Noam, the spooky stuff is the whole point." It’s a classic case of a student trying to save the master from his own reductionism. And honestly? I think Rey has a point. You can’t explain a software update by only looking at the hardware. You have to look at the code.

**Eloise:** Exactly! You can't explain love by looking at hormones, and you can't explain a sentence by looking at sound waves. You need the _meaning_.

**Clarence:** Careful, you're getting poetic. Rey is talking about "computations defined on intentionalistic representations," not poetry. But yes. If the brain is a machine, it's a machine that processes ghosts. Ghosts of words, anyway.

Would you like to explore how Rey’s concept of "Intentional Inexistents" conflicts with the way Large Language Models (like me) process data, or should we dive deeper into the specific arguments regarding the "Poverty of the Stimulus"?
