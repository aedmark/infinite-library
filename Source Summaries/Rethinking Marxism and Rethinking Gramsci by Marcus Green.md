**The Prison Notebooks: Or, Why Marxism Needed a Remix**

**Clarence:** Alright, take a breath. We are pivoting from the existential dread of Copenhagen to a fascist prison cell in Italy. The mood hasn't exactly lightened, but the stakes have shifted. We are looking at Antonio Gramsci, specifically through the lens of the journal _Rethinking Marxism_ and the colossal effort to translate his _Prison Notebooks_.1

**Eloise:** "Remix" is a great word for it! Gramsci is the ultimate "Yes, and..." philosopher. He looked at the rigid, "economics determines everything" version of Marxism that was popular in the early 20th century and said, "Okay, but what about culture? What about feelings? What about the stories we tell ourselves?" He’s the guy who realized you can’t just look at a spreadsheet to understand why people do what they do.

**The "Translation" Problem**

Here is the central tension of this collection: You cannot just copy-paste Gramsci into 2024.

The sources emphasize that Gramsci isn't a vending machine where you put in a coin and get a pre-packaged revolution. He was writing in a very specific context (fighting Mussolini, trying to figure out why the socialist revolution failed in the West). To use him today, you have to do what the text calls "living philology." You have to _translate_ his method, not just his words.

If you try to use his specific political analysis for our current situation, you’re doing it wrong. You have to take his _way of thinking_—his "philosophy of praxis"—and apply it to our mess.

**The Big Three: A Gramsci Glossary**

If you want to understand why Gramsci matters, you have to grapple with three concepts that keep popping up in these essays.

1. Hegemony (The Velvet Glove)

This is the big one. Before Gramsci, a lot of revolutionaries thought power was just a guy with a gun (coercion). Gramsci said, "No, that’s too simple."

Real power is when you get the oppressed people to agree to the system that oppresses them. It’s achieved through culture, education, media, and "common sense." It’s the difference between a dictatorship (dominion) and a stable modern state (hegemony).

2. The Subaltern (The Voiceless?)

Gramsci was obsessed with the groups history ignores. The "Subaltern" aren't just the poor; they are the people who have been pushed to the margins of the dominant narrative.2 But here is the kicker: Gramsci didn't just see them as victims. He saw them as complex historical actors who are often complicit in their own situation because of that pesky "hegemony" we just mentioned.

3. Common Sense (The Trap)

Clarence: This is my favorite. Usually, we think "common sense" is a good thing. Gramsci hated it.

Eloise: He didn't hate it! He just didn't trust it.

Clarence: Fair. For Gramsci, "Common Sense" is the messy, contradictory collection of beliefs we inherit from our grandmothers, the news, and the church. It’s a hodgepodge. It feels like "natural truth," but it’s actually just fossilized history. The goal is to turn "Common Sense" into "Good Sense"—a critical, coherent understanding of the world.

**The Joseph Buttigieg Factor**

We have to talk about the physical books. For a long time, English speakers only got the "Greatest Hits" version of Gramsci—snipped, edited, and smoothed over.

Joseph A. Buttigieg (yes, that is Mayor Pete’s dad, for those wondering about the lineage) spent years translating the _complete_ notebooks. And he made a crucial decision: **He kept the mess.**

Gramsci wrote in fragments.3 He crossed things out. He wrote in code to trick the prison censors. Buttigieg argued that we shouldn't try to fix the fragmentation. The fragmentary nature _is_ the point. Gramsci resisted the "Big System" answers. He wanted to show the work, the struggle, and the open-ended nature of thought.

**Eloise:** It’s so beautiful, really. It’s philosophy as a scrapbook. It proves that truth isn't a monolith you find; it’s a mosaic you have to piece together yourself.

**The Verdict**

The sources argue that Gramsci is a "critical modernist." He believed there was a real world out there (he wasn't a total postmodernist saying everything is just a story), but he knew that our access to that world is filtered through power, language, and history.

He teaches us that if you want to change the world, you can't just change the economy. You have to change the "Common Sense." You have to win the battle of ideas before you can win the battle for the state.

**Eloise & Clarence’s Editing Floor**

**Clarence:** I appreciate that we clarified the "Common Sense" distinction. It is the most dangerous phrase in the English language. "It's just common sense!" is usually followed by something atrociously unexamined.

**Eloise:** I just love that he wrote all this in prison. It’s the ultimate act of hope. You lock a man up to stop him from speaking, and he writes 3,000 pages that change how we understand the world 80 years later. That is the definition of "Good Sense."

**Clarence:** It is also a reminder that "fragmentation" isn't a failure. The _Prison Notebooks_ are incomplete, just like the _Crumbs_ were "scraps." There is a pattern here. We are attracted to the thinkers who admit they don't have the whole picture.

**Eloise:** Because we don't either!

Next Logical Question:

Since we touched on the "Subaltern" and the difficulty of them having a voice, should we look into Gayatri Spivak’s famous essay "Can the Subaltern Speak?" which directly challenges some of Gramsci’s hopes for representation?
