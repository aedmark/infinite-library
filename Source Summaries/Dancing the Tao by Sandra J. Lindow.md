### The Carrier Bag and the Way: A Look at Lindow’s "Dancing the Tao"

Sandra J. Lindow’s book isn't just a literary critique; it’s basically a map of Ursula K. Le Guin’s soul, drawn with Taoist ink. Lindow argues that Le Guin isn't merely spinning yarns about wizards or anarchists on the moon; she’s running high-level moral thought experiments. She’s taking the "hero’s journey"—which usually looks like a straight line or a spear thrown at an enemy—and bending it into a circle.

The Sack vs. The Spear

First off, we have to talk about the "Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction." This is Le Guin changing the game. Most history (and fiction) focuses on the Mammoth Hunters—the guys with the spears, the adrenaline, the conquest. That’s the "heroic trajectory." But Le Guin asks: What about the gatherers? What about the people holding the sack full of oats, roots, and babies? Lindow points out that Le Guin’s stories are shaped like that container. They aren’t about hitting a target; they’re about holding messy, disparate things together in a relationship. It’s a shift from conflict to connection.

Trauma, Darkness, and the Self

Lindow spends a lot of time in the dark, specifically with Tenar from Earthsea. This isn’t just fantasy stuff; it’s a deep dive into the "damaged child" archetype. Tenar’s time in the tombs is a brutal look at how early trauma and isolation can eat a person’s identity. But the Taoist twist here is that you don’t defeat the darkness by killing it. You integrate it. Le Guin rejects the idea that "light" is good and "dark" is wicked (a lazy binary often pinned on women). You have to own your shadow to be whole.

The Art of Not Pushing

Then there’s Shevek from The Dispossessed, who is basically the poster child for wei wu wei—action through non-action. This is the hardest concept for Western brains to chew on. Lindow contrasts Shevek’s anarchist philosophy with things like the Stanford Prison Experiment to show how easily humans build walls and hierarchies because they feel safe. But real change? That doesn't come from force. It comes from discussion, stillness, and removing the walls in your own head. It’s the paradox of doing by not doing.

Messiness is Holiness

In Always Coming Home, Le Guin creates a world that runs on "yin" energy. It’s messy. It’s organic. It’s not arranged in neat rows like a spreadsheet. Lindow notes that this "natural organic messiness" is actually a moral stance. Trying to be "pure" is usually a trap that leads to fascism or neurosis. The Kesh people in the book live in a hinge shape, not a grid, and their language is breathable. It’s about finding a center, not conquering a frontier.

Old Age and the Magic of Words

Finally, Lindow gives major props to Le Guin for how she writes old people. In a genre usually obsessed with youth, Le Guin lets her characters age, ache, and gain wisdom. Characters like Old Music show us that the later stages of moral development aren't about getting stronger; they’re about letting go. It’s about "leaving self behind" to keep what actually matters. And the tool for all this transformation? Language. Words are "soul-coats." If you can’t tell your own story, you don’t really exist.

In short, Lindow shows us that Le Guin used fiction to build a moral compass that points toward balance, not victory.

### Commentary

**Eloise:** Oh, I am absolutely vibrating! The "Carrier Bag" theory just makes so much sense to me. Why do we always focus on the spear? The spear is over in a second, but the bag? The bag is where we keep the food, the memories, the medicine! It’s where life actually happens! I love that Lindow picks up on the "messiness" of the Kesh people, too. Community _is_ messy. It’s loud and smells like cooking and wet dogs and arguments that get solved with hugs instead of lawsuits. The idea that "purity" is a denial of our humanity? Yes! That hits me right in the chest. We are supposed to be complicated!

**Clarence:** I’m stuck on _wei wu wei_. I always am. It sounds lovely in theory—"action through non-action"—but in practice? It’s terrifying. It requires a level of trust in the universe that I frankly do not possess. I’m neurotic; I want to _fix_ the wall, not just sit there and discuss why the wall is a mental construct until it dissolves. But... I suppose that’s the point Lindow is making about Le Guin. The "doing" is the source of the suffering. It’s the impulse to control the outcome that ruins the experiment. Also, the section on the "shadow" is vital. If you don't integrate the dark, it usually ends up running for public office in your subconscious.

**Next Step:** Would you like to try applying the "Carrier Bag Theory" to a modern piece of media (like a recent film or news event) to see how the narrative changes when you focus on "gathering" rather than "hunting"?
