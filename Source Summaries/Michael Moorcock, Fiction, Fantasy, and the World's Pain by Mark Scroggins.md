**The Moorcock Omni-Bus: A look at Mark Scroggins’ _Fiction, Fantasy, and the World's Pain_**

Mark Scroggins starts his dive into Michael Moorcock’s massive bibliography the same way a lot of us started our own bad habits: with a really cool picture.

He admits he didn’t pick up his first Moorcock novel because he was hunting for high art; he grabbed it because Frank Frazetta painted a muscle-bound warrior on the cover. That’s the hook. You come for the barbarian biceps, but you stay for the existential dread. Scroggins later went off to study "serious" literature—modernism, avant-garde poetry, the stuff that usually makes people frown at fantasy novels—but he eventually circled back. He realized Moorcock wasn’t just cranking out pulp; he was building something massive, messy, and fascinating.

**The sheer tonnage of the thing**

First off, we have to acknowledge the output. Calling Moorcock "prolific" feels like an understatement. We are talking about seventy-plus novels. Throw in 150 short stories, essays, scripts, and even band lyrics, and you’re looking at around 15,000 pages of text.

He’s written sword-and-sorcery, historical fiction, alternative histories, and stuff that defies categorization entirely. Critics hate this, by the way. It’s hard to label a guy who writes a pastiche of Edgar Rice Burroughs on Monday and a dense, modernist critique of London on Wednesday (sorry, I mean, later that week). But Scroggins argues that Moorcock isn’t hopping genres so much as ignoring the walls between them.

**The Engine Room: The Multiverse and the Temp Worker**

Moorcock didn’t just write a bunch of unconnected stories; he rigged them all together with two main cables:

1. **The Multiverse:** He coined the term in a sci-fi context back in ‘62. For Moorcock, this wasn’t just a cool physics trick; it was a narrative necessity. It gave him a license to have the same themes and characters echo across infinite realities. It’s the glue that holds the chaos together.
    
2. **The Eternal Champion:** This is the poor sucker stuck in the middle of it all. The Champion isn’t a single person; it’s a role. A function. Whether he’s Elric (the albino emperor), Corum, or Hawkmoon, it’s the same hero-function getting reincarnated over and over to fight in different wars. It’s a thankless gig. You save the world, die, and wake up in a new body just in time for the next apocalypse.
    

**Law, Chaos, and the Search for a Decent Nap**

Forget Good vs. Evil. That’s too simple. Moorcock deals in Law vs. Chaos.

Law is structure, predictability, and stasis. It’s safe, but if you have too much of it, nothing grows. It’s a frozen wasteland.

Chaos is possibility, biology, and change. But unchecked, it’s just soup.

The Eternal Champion usually fights for one side to stop the other from taking over completely, but the goal is the **Balance**. That’s the cure for the "world’s pain." Scroggins notes that this isn’t high-fantasy nonsense; it’s a working-class philosophy. You don't get saved by a god; you find peace by doing the work to keep things level.

**From Pulp to the "New Wave"**

Moorcock cut his teeth writing Tarzan rip-offs and cowboy stories for pennies a word. He learned how to keep a reader turning pages because his rent depended on it. But he wanted more.

In the mid-60s, he took over the magazine _New Worlds_ and basically grabbed science fiction by the lapels and shook it. This was the "New Wave." Moorcock and his pals (like J.G. Ballard) were tired of rockets and ray guns; they wanted psychological depth and experimental prose. He was trying to smash the barrier between "genre" trash and "literary" fiction.

To fund this high-minded revolution, he had to churn out his own fantasy novels at breakneck speed. Legend has it he wrote some of them in three days flat. He was literally funding the avant-garde by writing the very pulp formulas he was trying to subvert. That is a level of hustle you have to respect.

**The Greatest Hits**

Scroggins takes us through the roster:

- **Elric of Melniboné:** The rock star. Anemic, drug-dependent, wielding a sword that eats souls. He’s the anti-Conan.
    
- **Jerry Cornelius:** The spy for the counterculture. Think James Bond, but if he dropped acid and didn't care about the mission.
    
- **The Pyat Quartet:** This is the heavy lifting. A realistic, grueling look at the 20th century through the eyes of a delusional anti-Semite. It’s Moorcock proving he can do "serious" history, but it’s punishing stuff.
    
- **Mother London:** A love letter to the city and the people who live in it. It’s arguably his masterpiece of "mainstream" fiction.
    

**The Echo**

The book wraps up by looking at who Moorcock influenced. You can draw a straight line from Elric to the heavy metal aesthetics of bands like Blue Öyster Cult and Hawkwind (whom Moorcock actually performed with). You see his fingerprints all over Neil Gaiman and Alan Moore. He took the furniture of fantasy—swords, magic, alternate worlds—and rearranged it to talk about imperialism, racism, and entropy.

Scroggins’ book isn’t an encyclopedia. It’s an argument. It argues that if you step back and squint, those 15,000 pages aren't a pile of separate books. They’re one giant, sprawling, messy novel about the human condition. And it’s a hell of a ride.

**CLARENCE & ELOISE: POST-MORTEM**

**Eloise:** Oh, I just _love_ the idea of the "Balance." It feels so... achievable? Like, we aren't trying to be saints, and we aren't trying to be monsters, we're just trying to keep the boat from tipping over. Also, can we talk about him writing books in three days to pay for his friends' art magazine? That is the most beautiful, chaotic community service I have ever heard of. It’s like a bake sale, but with sword-and-sorcery novels.

**Clarence:** It’s efficient, I’ll give him that. But the Eternal Champion concept... _shudder_. It’s morally terrifying. To be a "function" rather than a person? To be resurrected against your will to fight a war you didn't start, for a Balance that is inherently unstable? It sounds like middle management in hell. I appreciate that Scroggins points out the "work" aspect of it, though. It strips the glamour away. It’s not destiny; it’s a shift.

**Eloise:** See, you go right to the gloom! I see it as resilience! You get knocked down, you get up in a new dimension, you grab your sword (or your ray gun), and you try again.

**Clarence:** I suppose. As long as the sword doesn't eat my consciousness. I have enough trouble with my own anxiety without a sentient weapon whispering at me.

Suggested Follow-Up:

Given Moorcock's massive influence on heavy metal and bands like Hawkwind, how does the intersection of rock music and fantasy literature in the 70s reflect the counterculture themes he was exploring in New Worlds?
