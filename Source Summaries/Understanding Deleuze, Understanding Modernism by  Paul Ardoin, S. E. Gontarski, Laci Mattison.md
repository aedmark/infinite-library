### Wiring the Brain to the Book: A Review of _Understanding Deleuze, Understanding Modernism_

Michel Foucault once threw a Molotov cocktail into the world of philosophy when he said, "Perhaps one day, this century will be known as Deleuzian." Was he joking? Maybe. But looking at _Understanding Deleuze, Understanding Modernism_ (edited by Paul Ardoin, S. E. Gontarski, and Laci Mattison), you get the distinct feeling that the joke is on anyone who ignored him.

This volume is a dual-processor. It runs two operations at once: it uses the brain-melting philosophy of Gilles Deleuze to crack open modernist literature, and it uses modernist literature (Woolf, Beckett, Kafka) to explain what on earth Deleuze was actually talking about. It’s not about putting literature in a box; it’s about showing how philosophy and art are entangled in a weird, beautiful, chaotic knot.

#### Part One: The Toolbox (Conceptualizing Deleuze)

You can't fix a car if you don't know what a wrench is. This section hands you the tools, but be warned: these tools are designed to dismantle your reality.

- The War on the Tree (Capitalism and Schizophrenia):
    
    Deleuze and his co-pilot Félix Guattari hated trees.1 Well, metaphorically. They despised "arborescent" thinking—hierarchical, rooted, top-down structures (like a family tree or a corporate org chart).2 Instead, they proposed the Rhizome. Think of crabgrass, or the internet, or a burrow. No center, no beginning, no end, just connection.
    
    They also introduce "Schizoanalysis." Forget the Freudian "Mommy-Daddy-Me" drama. They argue that desire is "homeless." It doesn't want to go back to the womb; it wants to assemble, connect, and break things. It’s about *use*, not *meaning*. Don't ask what a book means; ask how it works. Ask what it does to you.

- Kafka as a mechanic:
    
    When they read Kafka, they don't look for metaphors. They look at his writing as a "minor literature." This isn't an insult. "Minor" here means a minority voice hacking a major language from the inside. It’s revolutionary because it stutters; it breaks the clean, polite rules of the dominant culture.
    
- Proust and the Violence of Thought:
    
    Deleuze treats Proust’s In Search of Lost Time not as a memoir, but as an "apprenticeship of signs."3 We learn that thinking isn't a polite parlor game; it’s a violent act. We only truly think when we are forced to by a sign that confuses or hurts us.
    
- The Abstract Art of Philosophy (Difference and Repetition):
    
    This is the heavy lifting. Deleuze wants philosophy to do what abstract art did to painting.4 Stop trying to represent the world (painting a bowl of fruit) and start creating pure thought (painting the sensation of redness). It’s difficult reading because it’s supposed to be. It’s "stylistic violence" designed to snap you out of your habits.
    
- The Friend and the Idiot (What is Philosophy?):
    
    Philosophy isn't about owning wisdom; it’s about being a "friend" to it. It requires "conceptual personae"—characters like the Idiot, who is too stupid to understand the common assumptions everyone else makes, and therefore is the only one who can really think.5
    

#### Part Two: The Laboratory (Aesthetics)

Here, the book plugs these concepts into the actual texts of modernism. It turns out, the modernists were Deleuzian before Deleuze was born.

- **Woolf and the Atoms:** Virginia Woolf didn't just write characters; she wrote "haecceities"—singular moments of "this-ness." When she writes about the waves or a day in the life of Mrs. Dalloway, she’s saturating every atom, moving beyond the human into the molecular.
    
- **The Baroque House of Mirrors:** The book takes a deep dive into Leibniz and the Baroque. Imagine a room with no windows (the Monad), but the inside is full of mirrors reflecting the entire universe from a single point of view. This is the "Fold." Modernists like Borges and Beckett navigate this house of mirrors, dealing with the "hallucinatory" nature of reality.
    
- **Beckett’s Silence:** Samuel Beckett is the ultimate test case. His narrators, like in _The Unnamable_, are trapped in a paradox: they must speak, but they have nothing to say. They are peeling back the curtain of language to show the void behind it. It’s the "body without organs" screaming in the dark.
    

#### Part Three: The Survival Kit (Glossary)

The book ends not with a dictionary, but with a series of mini-essays. Terms like _Body without Organs_, _Assemblage_, _Line of Flight_, and _Virtual/Actual_ are unpacked. This is crucial because Deleuze reuses words but changes their batteries every time, making them buzz with different frequencies depending on the context.

### The Editors' Desk

**Eloise:** "Desire is homeless." That line? It wrecked me. It’s so lonely but so incredibly freeing. We spend so much time trying to find a home for our feelings, trying to fit them into these little boxes of "this means I’m in love" or "this means I’m sad." But Deleuze says, _No, honey, your desire is a nomad._ It’s supposed to wander.6 It’s supposed to break things. And the idea of being an "Idiot" to find the truth? Sign me up. I’ve been practicing my whole life! Also, can we talk about Woolf saturating every atom? That is exactly what a good morning feels like. You aren't a person; you're just... coffee and sunlight and dust motes.

**Clarence:** I’m stuck on the "War on the Tree." It’s charmingly anarchic, but have you ever tried to organize a bookshelf without a hierarchy? It’s a mess. However, I concede the point about the Rhizome. The internet has certainly proven that we are moving away from roots and toward... whatever this chaotic sprawling mess of information is. What really interests me is the "Violence of Thought." We usually think of philosophy as this calm, bearded man sitting on a rock. But Deleuze says thinking only happens when you get hit by a bus (metaphorically). You don't think until you _have_ to. Until the world stops making sense. That’s terrifying. It implies we are sleepwalking 90% of the time.

**Eloise:** We probably are! That’s why we need art. To slap us awake!

**Clarence:** A gentle slap would suffice, Eloise. I don't need a "Body without Organs" scream every Tuesday.

Next logical step:

Since we've touched on the "Body without Organs" and the difference between "Schizoanalysis" and traditional psychoanalysis, would you like to explore how Deleuze and Guattari specifically deconstructed the Oedipus Complex and why they believed it was a tool of political repression?
