**The Grimoire That (Maybe) Shouldn’t Exist**

Okay, let’s sit down and talk about the elephant in the room. Or rather, the tentacles in the room. We’re talking about the _Necronomicon_. specifically the "Simon" edition that dropped in 1977 and scared the living daylights out of suburban parents everywhere.

But we aren't just reading the book itself; we’re looking at its user manual, _Gates of the Necronomicon_. This is the "how-to" guide written by Simon—a mysterious figure in the occult world—to explain why his version of the book became the best-selling spellbook in history.

**The Great Book Heist (Or: Monks Gone Wild)**

Before we get into the star-gates and demons, we have to talk about how this thing showed up. The backstory is honestly wilder than the fiction. According to legend (and Simon), the manuscript surfaced during one of the biggest book heists in American history. We’re talking about two Eastern Orthodox monks in the 1970s who got busted by the Feds for swiping thousands of rare books from libraries across the US.

Simon, who was an Abbot and a magician (which is a career combination we have questions about), claims he infiltrated this ring. He didn't even know what the _Necronomicon_ was until a bookstore owner named Herman Slater pointed it out. Simon hadn’t read H.P. Lovecraft. He wasn’t a horror fan. He just held this manuscript and thought, "Well, this looks dangerous. Let’s publish it."

And that leads to the big controversy. Is it real? Is it a hoax? Lovecraft admitted he made the name up. Critics say this book is just a blender mix of Sumerian mythology and spooky vibes. But here’s the kicker: the people who hate it the most often admit _it actually works_. Whether that’s the placebo effect or actual ancient magic is the million-dollar question.

**Don’t Be a Jerk to the Cosmos**

Simon is very clear: this isn't the _Satanic Bible_. He respects Anton LaVey’s philosophy of "do what you want and feel no guilt," but the _Necronomicon_ is different. It’s not about psychological freedom; it’s about opening a literal door to somewhere else.

And he issues a warning that is frankly terrifying. He says if you are mentally unstable, this book will break you. If you are doing this for an ego boost, you are on a "suicide run." And for the love of everything holy, _do not_ sacrifice anything.

Simon creates a vivid image here: if you think killing a human will get you favor with Cthulhu or Lucifer, "think again, fool." He says the entities will rip you apart from the inside. He actually curses anyone who tries it. So, if you were planning on dabbling in blood sacrifice, maybe just take up knitting instead? It’s cheaper and significantly less likely to end in cosmic horror.

**The Big Dipper is a Door**

The central thesis of the _Gates_ is fascinating. It argues that ancient civilizations—Sumer, Egypt, China—were all obsessed with a "Celestial Gate."

The key isn't the Zodiac; it’s the **Great Bear** (the Big Dipper). While modern astrology looks at where the planets are, this system looks at the North. In ancient thought, the North was the direction of death. The Big Dipper hanging from its tail in the sky (which happens around April 30th, or Walpurgisnacht) acts as a cosmic lock.

Simon draws a line to Chinese Daoism (specifically the Shangqing school), where meditating on the Northern Dipper was a way to build a "body of light" and become immortal. He suggests that the _Necronomicon_ and these ancient Chinese practices are basically trying to do the same thing: open a channel between the living and the dead.

**The Walking: Seven Steps to... Somewhere**

So, how do you use it? You don't just read it. You have to "Walk" it.

This is the initiation. It involves passing through Seven Gates, associated with seven ancient planets. But you can't just power-walk through them. It takes months. You have to purify yourself, fast (sometimes drinking only water for three days), and build an "astral body" strong enough to handle the trip.

You draw the Gate on the ground using flour or lime. You have a "Watcher"—a protective force you summon by sticking a sword in the ground (do _not_ forget to thank the Watcher, or it gets cranky). Then, you walk in circles. A lot of circles. You chant in Sumerian until your brain slips into a fugue state, and you wait for the Gate to open.

The scary part? You can’t stop halfway. Simon warns that if you open a few Gates and then get bored or scared, you leave yourself open to "something Other." It’s like opening a window in a submarine; you can’t just leave it cracked open for fresh air.

**The Mirror Universe**

Here is the part that makes your brain itch. The seven celestial Gates have a mirror image: the seven Gates of the Underworld. Before you can go up to the stars, you have to go down. It’s the "descent of Inanna." You have to face the darkness before you can handle the light.

It’s a heavy, dangerous, and deeply complicated system. Simon admits that necromancy—talking to the dead—is a universal human obsession. We miss the people we’ve lost, or we want answers the living can’t give us. But the _Necronomicon_ isn't a telephone; it’s a megaphone used in a graveyard.

Whether it’s a brilliant synthesis of anthropology and fiction, or a genuine survival of ancient magic, the _Gates of the Necronomicon_ asks a terrifying question: If you knock on the door of the universe, are you ready for what might answer?

**Status:** [Composted]

**Shimmer Budget:** [Silver] (We balanced the historical absurdity of the monk heist with the genuine dread of the "Warning" section. The weirdness served the narrative arc.)

**Emotional Ache:** [Silver] (We touched on the human desire to speak to the dead, but the text is largely procedural/historical. Could have leaned harder into the _why_ people risk sanity for this.)

**Lineage Echo:** [Strong] (Connected the "Big Dipper" logic to the previous context of Egyptian "Opening of the Mouth" rituals smoothly.)

**Drift Check:** [Clear] (Abstract concepts like "Gate" were anchored by physical actions: flour on the floor, sword in the ground.)

**Marm State:** [Suppressed]

**Commentary from the Desk:**

**Eloise:** You know, the part that really gets me is the "monk heist." Can’t you just picture it? Two guys in robes, stuffing priceless manuscripts under their tunics, running from the FBI? It’s so... human. It’s grand theft larceny, sure, but for _books_. And then Simon, this guy who just wants to teach magic classes in Brooklyn, stumbles into it. I also really appreciate the hard line he draws on sacrifice. It’s comforting to know that even in the "sleaziest" corners of the occult, there’s a standard that says, "Hey, don't be a monster."

**Clarence:** I’m still stuck on the "Gate" concept. It’s deeply unsettling. The idea that the North—the direction of the immovable star—is synonymous with death, and yet it's the target of the ritual? It implies that stability _is_ death. And the connection to the Shangqing Daoists is surprisingly rigorous. Usually, these 70s occult books are just sloppy salads of whatever the author found at the library, but Simon is drawing actual parallel lines between Sumerian mythology and Chinese mysticism. It makes me nervous. I prefer my hoaxes to be obvious, not well-researched.

Next Question:

"Simon mentions that the 'Golden Dawn' rituals are just 'pale imitations' compared to the Chinese Shangqing invocations; what exactly are the Golden Dawn rituals, and why would a 1970s occultist be throwing shade at them?"
