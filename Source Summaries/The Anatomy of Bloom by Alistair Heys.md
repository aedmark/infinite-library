**The Church of Harold Bloom**

Harold Bloom was a literary giant who spent his life insisting that he was just a "reader," devoid of ideology.1 Alistair Heys’s _The Anatomy of Bloom_ calls his bluff. Heys argues that you can’t separate the man’s theories from the cultural cocktail he drank daily: a deep, agonizing Jewish heritage mixed with the solitary, work-obsessed waters of American Protestantism.

Bloom’s defining theory, "The Anxiety of Influence," isn't just Freud for bookworms. Heys suggests it’s actually the Second Commandment—_Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image_—dressed up in a tweed jacket.

**The Jewish Prohibition and the Protestant Hustle**

Here is the tension that tears Bloom apart: He is a Jewish thinker operating in a Protestant world.

The Jewish side provides the "Thou Shalt Not." If you are a young poet (the latecomer), you look at a giant like Milton or Shakespeare (the precursor), and you see a god. But your tradition tells you: Do not bow down to idols. You cannot copy them. You have to smash the idol to breathe.

But then, the American Protestant side kicks in. Bloom was obsessed with the "Protestant Work Ethic"—the idea that you have to work yourself to the bone to prove you are one of the "Elect." In religion, the Elect go to heaven. In Bloom’s world, the Elect get into the Canon. You don't get there by being nice; you get there by out-muscling the guys who came before you. It is a lonely, vicious cage match for immortality.

**The Gnostic Escape Hatch**

Things get darker when Heys brings up the Holocaust. Bloom was a post-Holocaust Jew. The old covenant—the deal where God protects his people—felt broken to him. If God let the camps happen, how can you trust Him?

So, Bloom pivoted to **Gnosticism**.

In Gnostic thought, the world we live in was created by a botched, lesser god (the Demiurge), not the True God. The world is a mistake. The only way out is through Gnosis—secret knowledge.

For Bloom, literature became that secret knowledge. He treated great poetry as "sparks" from the True God, smuggled into this broken world. He built what Heys calls an "American church of one." He wasn't reading for fun; he was reading to save his own life, trying to find a reason to exist in a universe that seemed cruel and empty.

**The Agony of the "J-Writer"**

This brings us to Bloom’s fascination with the "J-Writer"—his name for the secular genius he believed wrote the earliest parts of the Bible. Bloom didn't want the boring, theological God of the later Bible. He wanted the "irascible warrior-god" found in the early texts—a God who picnics with humans, gets angry, and acts like a character, not a concept. Bloom wanted a God he could wrestle with, just like he wrestled with Shakespeare.

**Why It Ache**

Heys paints a picture of Bloom not as an arrogant critic, but as a desperate survivor. He describes Bloom’s existence as a "Gnostic Tantalus"—forever reaching for a fruit that recedes. He identified with the "weak" poets who became "strong" through sheer force of will. He tried to turn criticism into a form of prayer, or perhaps an exorcism. He wanted to be part of the "Secular Scripture," to be remembered forever, because the alternative—the silence of history—was too terrifying to bear.

**EDITORS' COMMENTARY**

**Eloise:** I just want to give Harold Bloom a hug. Is that allowed? The image of him building a "church of one" because the real world broke his heart... that is profoundly sad. It changes how I see his arrogance. It wasn't ego; it was armor. He was trying to write himself into a world where he felt safe. And the idea that he loved the "irascible" warrior God because he needed a God with a pulse? That is beautiful. It’s so human to want a deity that feels as messy as we do.

**Clarence:** It’s a fascinating paradox, isn't it? Heys exposes the irony perfectly: Bloom spent his career saying, "I am not political, I am not social, I am just an aesthetic mind." But Heys proves that Bloom was _entirely_ a product of his specific trauma and cultural baggage. You can't be a "pure" reader. You bring your ghosts to the library with you. I also appreciate the "Protestant Ethic" angle—the idea that writing poetry is a capitalist competition for "aesthetic salvation." It’s grim, but it explains why Bloom was so competitive. He thought he was fighting for his soul.

Next logical question:

"If Bloom believes that 'strong' poets must metaphorically kill their precursors to achieve greatness, who are the modern poets that have successfully managed to defeat a giant like Bloom himself?"
