**The Sticky, Messy, and Necessary Business of “We-ness”**

Let’s be real for a second: humans are pack animals. We aren’t lone wolves, no matter how cool that looks on a vintage t-shirt. We are hardwired, right down to our marrow, to look for other people and say, "You? Me too." William Marsiglio calls this "we-ness," and honestly, it’s a concept that explains about 90% of why we do the things we do—for better or for absolute disaster.

Marsiglio isn't talking about some dry academic metric where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. He’s talking about the _vibe_. It’s that click in your brain, that psychological shift where "I" becomes "Us." It’s an individual experience of a collective feeling. And it comes in flavors.

First, you’ve got the deep stuff—the "ride or die" connection. This is the Dyadic We-ness. It’s you and your partner, you and your best friend, or that mentor who actually gives a damn about your career. It’s intimate, it’s heavy, and it requires maintenance. Then there’s the Ideational stuff—bonding over an idea. This is why you feel an instant kinship with someone wearing the same obscure band merch or voting for the same candidate. And finally, there’s the spontaneous stuff. That fleeting moment when you high-five a stranger because your team just scored. It’s surface-level, sure, but the dopamine hit is real.

But here is the catch—and this is where things get complicated—we-ness is morally neutral. It’s just a tool, like a hammer. You can build a house with it, or you can break someone’s kneecaps.

History is littered with people who weaponized this feeling. Ruthless leaders (you know the list: Hitler, Stalin, Putin) are experts at hacking our desire to belong. They curate a "we" that is entirely dependent on a hated "them." It happens in street gangs, where the desperate need for family and respect gets twisted into violence. It happens in the "blue shield" of police silence, where loyalty to the brotherhood overrides the duty to the truth. When the bond becomes a cage that keeps outsiders out and accountability down, that warm fuzzy feeling of belonging turns cold and dangerous.

We are also trying to figure out who we are in a world that won’t stop screaming at us. We define ourselves by who we stand with. But modern tech has thrown a wrench in the gears. We’re suffering from what Kenneth Gergen called "multiphrenia"—a splintered mind. We are one person on LinkedIn, another on Twitter, and another in the family group chat. We are "networked individuals," curating a digital self that craves validation (or "charms" and likes) to feel anchored. We are even starting to form bonds with AI, asking if a robot can be a friend, which opens a whole new can of philosophical worms about what friendship actually _is_.

And let's talk about the ache of missing it. Loneliness isn’t just being alone; it’s a feedback loop of negative thoughts. It’s the absence of that echo, the silence where a "we" should be. That’s why we cling to tribes, even bad ones.

So, where does that leave us? Marsiglio suggests we need to be a little more deliberate about our bonding. We need to cultivate "prosocial" qualities—empathy, compassion, gratitude. We need to look for the "we" that expands our world rather than shrinking it. We need the kind of bond that allows for a "particularistic altruism"—taking care of our own—while also having the "enlightened self-interest" to realize that helping the wider world actually helps us, too.

In the end, we are all just trying to find our people. The trick is making sure that in finding them, we don’t lose our humanity.

### Commentary

**Eloise:** Oh, I just love this! The idea that "we-ness" is a skill we can practice? That is so beautiful. It reminds me of working at the community center—you see these people from totally different walks of life, and suddenly, over a shared pot of terrible coffee, they become a _unit_. It’s magic! But I really appreciate that we didn't sugarcoat the loneliness part. That ache is real, and acknowledging it is the first step to fixing it. We need more "sparkplugs" in the world, people who just ignite that togetherness!

**Clarence:** Calm down, Sparkplug. Look, the text is better, but I’m still stuck on the "moral neutrality" of the concept. It’s terrifying, frankly. The same psychological mechanism that builds a soup kitchen builds a fascist regime. That’s not just a "complication," that’s the central paradox of human social existence. And don’t get me started on the "AI friendship" bit. If your best friend is an algorithm that can’t disagree with you, you aren’t experiencing "we-ness," you’re experiencing narcissism with a user interface. But, I suppose the revision captures the _nuance_ well enough without sounding like a dissertation.

**Next Step:** Since Marsiglio mentions that "we-ness" can be weaponized by bad actors, would you like to explore a specific historical or modern case study (like the "Blue Shield" or specific political movements) to see exactly _how_ that manipulation of belonging happens step-by-step?
