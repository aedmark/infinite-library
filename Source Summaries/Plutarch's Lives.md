## The Original Reality TV: Plutarch’s _Lives_, Vol. I

If you strip away the marble busts and the toga-wearing pretension, Plutarch’s _Lives_ is basically the ancient equivalent of _Vanity Fair_ meets a moral philosophy seminar. This isn’t a textbook where you memorize dates of battles. It’s a gossip column written by a priest who wants you to be a better person.

Volume I, specifically the Stewart and Long translation from 1894, is our entry point into this massive project. It introduces us to the man himself and the first batch of his famous "Parallel Lives"—where he takes a Greek celebrity and a Roman celebrity, smushes them together like two dolls, and asks, "Okay, who wore 'Greatness' better?"

#### The Man Behind the Curtain: Plutarch

Before we get to the heroes, we meet Plutarch. And honestly? He sounds lovely. Born in Chaeroneia (think small-town Greece) around A.D. 45, he was a student, a traveler, and eventually a priest of Apollo at Delphi.1

He spent time in Rome, rubbing elbows with the elite, but—and Clarence loves this detail—he admitted he was terrible at Latin.2 He was so busy teaching philosophy and doing "public affairs" that he didn't have time to learn the grammar.3 He basically learned Latin by vibing with it; he understood the words because he already knew the facts they were describing.

But the real heartbreaker is his domestic life. He calls himself a "king in his own house." He wrote a letter to his wife, Timoxena, after the death of their daughter (also Timoxena) that is so tender it hurts. He describes his life as a book with "scarcely an erasure." He wasn't a stoic robot; he was a dad who loved his family and his friends.

#### The "Anti-History" Approach

Plutarch throws shade at standard historians right in the preface. He says, essentially, "I’m not writing History; I’m writing Lives."

He doesn't care about the layout of a battlefield where 10,000 men died. He cares about a joke Alexander the Great made at a dinner party. He argues that a "slight circumstance, a word, or a jest" tells you more about a human soul than a siege.4 He’s looking for the _ethos_ (character), not just the _praxis_ (action).5

He uses the metaphor of a mirror. He says he writes these lives so he can look into them "as if he had looked in a glass" to adjust his own behavior. He’s trying to "form himself in the mould" of these great men. It’s self-help through biography.

#### The Matchups (Volume I Fight Card)

The structure is the famous "Parallel Lives." He pairs a Greek and a Roman who share a vibe, tells their stories, and then compares them.

- **Theseus (Greek) vs. Romulus (Roman):** The Founders. Both have murky, mythological origins involving gods and beasts. Theseus dealt with the Minotaur; Romulus was raised by a wolf.6 Both founded major cities (Athens and Rome). Both had serious drama.
    
- **Lykurgus (Greek) vs. Numa (Roman):** The Lawgivers. Lykurgus is the Spartan hardliner—he banned luxury, made everyone eat in mess halls, and arguably hated fun. Numa is the Roman peaceful mystic—he talked to nymphs, established the Vestal Virgins, and tried to chill everyone out.7
    
- **Solon (Greek) vs. Poplicola (Roman):** The Politicians. Solon tried to fix Athens with poetry and debt relief.8 Poplicola (literally "Lover of the People") helped overthrow the Roman kings. Poplicola is famous for tearing down his own mansion just because the neighbors whispered that it looked too "tyrannical." Now _that_ is image management.
    

#### The "Stewart and Long" Flavor

This specific 1894 edition aims for "plain language." It’s trying to scrub away the errors of previous translations (sorry, Dryden and North) to give us a Plutarch that feels accurate. It acknowledges that Plutarch himself was sometimes "often inaccurate" and his anecdotes could be "absurd," but that’s part of the charm. He preserved facts that actual historians threw away because he knew that the weird stuff is where the humanity lives.

**Eloise:** I am absolutely weepy over the "scarcely an erasure" comment. Can you imagine loving your life and your family so much that you wouldn't edit a single page? That is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. And I love that he admits he was bad at Latin! It makes him feel so much less intimidating. Like, here is one of the smartest men in history, and even he struggled with his Duolingo lessons.

**Clarence:** I find the "Poplicola maneuver" fascinating. The man hears people gossiping that his house is too big, so he demolishes it. That is a level of performative humility that modern politicians could only dream of. But I also appreciate the distinction Plutarch makes between _character_ and _achievement_. We tend to judge leaders by their GDP growth or their conquests. Plutarch judges them by how they treat their friends or how they react to a joke. He’s essentially arguing that the "micro" explains the "macro." If you want to understand why an empire fell, look at how the emperor treated his wife.

**Plutarch suggests we look into these lives like a mirror to "adjust" our own behavior.** In a modern context, who—if anyone—serves this function for us now? Do we have public figures we actually look to for _moral_ formatting, or have we replaced "character models" with "success models" (billionaires, celebrities) who offer no ethical reflection at all?

### Plutarch’s _Lives_, Volume II: The Deep Cuts

If Volume I was the pilot episode that got everyone hooked, Volume II is where the showrunners really start flexing their character development skills. We are diving back into the _Parallel Lives_, specifically looking at heavy hitters like **Themistokles**, **Romulus**, **Aristides**, and **Cato**.

But before we get lost in the togas, let’s talk about Plutarch’s method, because it’s distinct. He isn’t trying to be a camera recording everything; he is painting. He explicitly says that a painter doesn't obsess over every vein in a foot—they focus on the face and the eyes, where the soul lives. Plutarch does the same. He ignores massive military campaigns to focus on a single joke or a casual insult, because that’s where the "real" person hides.

#### The "House-Guest" Protocol

Plutarch views writing these biographies as a form of hospitality. He imagines inviting these great men into his home as house-guests. He "entertains" them, observing their habits and virtues so he can decide which traits to keep and which to kick out of his own life. It’s a beautiful, slightly haunting idea: writing as a way of hanging out with ghosts to improve your own manners.

#### The Art of the _Synkrisis_

In this volume, the structural genius of the _Parallel Lives_ really shines.

1. **The Pair:** He takes a Greek (like Aristides the Just) and matches him with a Roman (like Cato the Censor).
    
2. **The Narrative:** He tells their stories from birth to death.
    
3. **The _Synkrisis_:** This is the "comparison" at the end.
    

This isn't just for fun; it’s a diagnostic tool. By holding two lives up against each other, the specific flavors of their virtue pop out. Aristides was just, and Cato was strict—but how did their environments change that? It teaches the reader "discrimination"—the ability to make fine distinctions between good and better.

#### The Cultural Tightrope

We also have to remember who is holding the pen. Plutarch was Greek, writing under the Roman Empire. He navigates this with a fascinating mix of respect and subtle shade. He creates a "macrotext"—a unified world where Greek intellect often guides Roman power. He sees the Romans as capable of greatness, but often needing the "restraint" of Greek education to keep them from acting like barbarians.

**Eloise:** I am completely taken by the "house-guest" concept. It changes the whole vibe of reading history. You aren’t studying a dusty textbook; you’re setting an extra place at the dinner table. It feels so intimate! Imagine inviting Cato over, though? Talk about a stressful dinner guest. He’d probably criticize your silverware and tell you you’re eating too much. But that’s the point, isn’t it? You learn from him, even if he’s annoying.

**Clarence:** Precisely. And don't overlook the _prohairesis_—the decision-making process. Plutarch is obsessed with _why_ people make choices. Most modern biographies are just a sequence of events: "He did this, then he went there." Plutarch asks, "What was the moral calculus in his head when he decided to exile his rival?" He respects human nature enough to know that a mistake isn't always villainy; sometimes it's just a miscalibrated virtue. Also, his "Greeks vs. Romans" dynamic is the ancient equivalent of a cultural study. He’s essentially saying, "The Romans have the hardware (military), but we Greeks provide the software (philosophy)."

**Plutarch uses the "small things"—a joke, a casual remark—to judge character.** In our current digital age, where everyone leaves a massive trail of "small things" (tweets, comments, likes), do you think we have become _better_ at judging character, or have we lost the context that Plutarch worked so hard to preserve?
